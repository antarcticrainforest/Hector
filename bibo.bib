  Abstract                 = {It has been recently demonstrated that stratiform heating plays a critical role in the scale-selection of organized tropical convection, in an aquaplanet version of a coarse-resolution atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a stochastic multicloud cumulus parameterization scheme. It is shown that Madden--Julian oscillation-like organization dominates when the model is tuned to produce strong and long lived stratiform heating while it gives rise to mostly convectively coupled waves in the case of weak and short lived stratiform clouds. The study is extended here to the case of an asymmetric forcing mimicking the migration of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) during summer to understand the impact of changes in stratiform heating on the monsoon dynamics. Consistent with the equatorial ITCZ case, strong and long lived stratiform heating promotes northward and eastward moving intraseasonal disturbances while weak and short lived stratiform heating yields mostly westward propgating synoptic scale low pressure systems. Moreover, the underlying intraseasonal versus low pressure system activity seems to impact the strength and extend of the monsoon trough (MT). In the regime with intraseasonal activity the MT is much stronger and extends northward while in the low pressure system case MT is some what weaker in strength but extends further westward. In the low pressure dominated regime, the background vorticity and zonal wind profiles over the monsoon trough are consistent with the observations.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract A two-dimensional nonlinear numerical model has been used to examine the effects of the ambient wind on the development of characteristic features of the sea breeze. The specific features that were examined were the maximum shoreward velocity component (both total and as a perturbation from the large-scale flow) anywhere in the simulation domain, the inland penetration of the sea breeze, the depth of the inflow layer at the coastline, the maximum vertical velocity anywhere in the domain, the maximum potential-temperature gradient anywhere in the domain, and the surface heat flux. Thirty-one simulators were performed, with large-scale geostrophic winds ranging from onshore (i.e., supporting) flow of 15 m s−1 to offshore (i.e., opposing) flow of 15 m s−1, at 1 m s−1 intervals. The results indicated that the sea-breeze perturbation was suppressed for onshore large-scale flow of a few meters per second or more. In contrast, a sea breeze was produced for opposing large-scale flow as strong as 11 m s−1. The sea-breeze cell was located offshore for strong opposing flow, with the sea-breeze velocities (both horizontal and vertical) being weaker than when the sea breeze penetrated inland. Both the stable stratification over the water and the convergence term in the froutogenesis equation are important factors in the sensitivity of the sea breeze to the large-scale flow. },

  Abstract                 = {Idealized numerical simulations of Florida convection are performed with a coupled atmosphere–land surface model to identify the roles of initial soil moisture, coastline curvature, and land-breeze circulations on sea- breeze-initiated precipitation. The 3D Goddard Cumulus Ensemble cloud-resolving model is coupled with the Goddard Parameterization for Land–Atmosphere–Cloud Exchange land surface model, thus providing a tool to simulate more realistically land surface–atmosphere interaction and convective initiation. Eight simulations are conducted with either straight or curved coastlines, initially homogeneous soil moisture or initially variable soil moisture, and initially homogeneous horizontal winds or initially variable horizontal winds (land breezes). An additional simulation is performed to assess the role of Lake Okeechobee on convective development.
All model simulations capture the diurnal evolution and general distribution of sea-breeze-initiated precipitation over central Florida. The distribution of initial soil moisture influences the timing and location of subsequent precipitation. Soil moisture acts as a moisture source for the atmosphere, increases the convectively available potential energy, and thus preferentially focuses heavy precipitation over existing wet soil. Soil moisture–induced mesoscale circulations do not produce heavy precipitation. Coastline curvature has a major impact on the timing and location of precipitation. Earlier low-level convergence occurs inland of convex coastlines, and subsequent heavy precipitation occurs earlier in simulations with curved coastlines. Early-morning land breezes influence the timing of precipitation by modifying low-level convergence. Because of nonlinear interaction between coastline curvature and soil moisture, the highest peak accumulated rainfall and highest peak rain rates occur in simulations with both coastline curvature and initial soil moisture variations. Lake Okeechobee influences the timing and location of precipitation because of strong lake-breeze circulations.},

  Abstract                 = {A cellular automaton (CA) is introduced to the deep convection parametrization of the high-resolution limited-area model Aire LimitÃ©e Adaptation/Application de la Recherche Ã  l'OpÃ©rationnel (ALARO). The self-organizational characteristics of the CA allow for lateral communication between adjacent numerical weather prediction (NWP) model grid boxes and add additional memory to the deep convection scheme. The CA acts in two horizontal dimensions, with finer grid spacing than the NWP model. It is randomly seeded in regions where convective available potential energy (CAPE) exceeds a threshold value. Both deterministic and probabilistic rules, coupled to the large-scale wind, are explored to evolve the CA in time. Case studies indicate that the scheme has the potential to organize cells along convective squall lines and enhance advective effects. An ensemble of forecasts using the present CA scheme demonstrated an ensemble spread in the resolved wind field in regions where deep convection is large. Such a spread represents the uncertainty due to subgrid variability of deep convection and could be an interesting addition to an ensemble prediction system.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The development of tropical island thunderstorms in the maritime continent were investigated over the Tiwi Islands to the north of the Australian continent. A satellite cloud climatology was developed to examine these island thunderstorms, locally known as Hectors. During the pre-monsoon period of 1990 and 1991 Hectors were observed on 70\% of days. These Hectors were observed to occur under two distinct environmental flow regimes. Under easterly flow, development occurred on the western end of the island and conversely under westerly flow, development occurred to the east. Hectors were also observed to have three distinct modes of development (Hector, suppressed and late developing) and one mode of non-development (non-Hector). Satellite cloud climatologies were developed and mean atmospheric characteristics were determined for each of these development modes. Hectors developed under conditions of moderate convective available potential energy, moderate shear and high moisture availability. Sub-cloud layer winds were also thought to contribute to the structure of the storm. Non-Hector and suppressed Hector days usually occurred after a previous convective disturbance such as a monsoon low or squall line and had typically low convective available potential energy and high values of convective inhibition. Conditions for late developing Hectors appeared to be conducive for thunderstorm development with high convective available potential energy and low values of convective inhibition. However, early initiation was suppressed by high shear conditions. Development in the late developing mode could be more intense than in other modes. Copyright © 2001 Royal Meteorological Society},

The model precipitates a few hours after sunrise, as it does not represent correctly the morning development of a growing cumulus boundary layer. In the single column model, precipitation is closely linked to the mean forcing and surface evaporation, but the phase of diurnal varying omega forcing in relation to the diurnal solar cycle determines the relation of convective to large-scale precipitation in the control model, as well as cloudiness and the net radiation balance. With diurnal subsidence peaking at midnight, but no mean ascent, the model shows a quasi 2-day precipitation mode. With both strong mean ascent and diurnal forcing, ascent peaking in the daytime gave stratiform rain with large cloud cover and very low surface net radiation, while daytime subsidence and ascent at night gave strong daytime convective precipitation and high net radiation.},

  Abstract                 = {Fractals are objects which have a similar appearance when viewed at different scales. Such objects have detail at arbitrarily small scales, making them too complex to be represented by Euclidean space. They are assigned a dimension which is non-integer. Some natural phenomena have been modelled as fractals with success; examples include geologic deposits, topographical surfaces and seismic activity. In particular, time series data has been represented as a curve with dimension between one and two. There are many different ways of defining fractal dimension. Most are equivalent in the continuous domain, but when applied in practice to discrete data sets lead to different results. Three methods for estimating fractal dimension are evaluated for accuracy. Two standard algorithms, Hurst's rescaled range analysis and the box-counting method, are compared with a recently introduced method which has not yet been widely used. It will be seen that this last method offers superior efficiency and accuracy, and it is recommended for fractal dimension calculations for time series data. We have applied these fractal analysis techniques to rainfall time series data from a number of gauge locations in Queensland. The suitability of fractal analysis for rainfall time series data is discussed, as is the question of how the theory might aid our interpretation of rainfall data.},

The convection-permitting 1.5-km simulation is carried out without convective parametrisation. As in previous studies, increasing resolution (especially from 50 to 12 km) is found to improve the representation of orographic precipitation. The 50-km simulation underestimates mean precipitation over the mountainous region of Wales, and event intensity tends to be too weak; this bias is reduced in both the 12- and 1.5-km simulations for both summer and winter. In south-east England lowlands where summer extremes are mostly convective, increasing resolution does not necessary lead to an improvement in the simulation. For the 12-km simulation, simulated daily extreme events are overly intense. Even though the average intensity of summer daily extremes is improved in the 1.5-km simulation, this simulation has a poorer mean bias with too many events exceeding high thresholds. Spatial density and clustering of summer extremes in south-east England are poorly simulated in both the 12- and 1.5-km simulations. In general, we have not found any clear evidence to show that the 1.5-km simulation is superior to the 12-km simulation, or vice versa at the daily level.},

  Abstract                 = { AbstractThe Asian monsoon is a planetary-scale circulation system powered by the release of latent heat, but important features of deep convection and rainfall distribution cannot be adequately represented by the large-scale patterns. This is mainly due to the strong influences of terrain that are important across a wide range of horizontal scales, especially over the Maritime Continent where the complex terrain has a dominant effect on the behavior of convective rainfall during the boreal winter monsoon. This chapter is a review and summary of published results on the effects on monsoon convection due to interactions between the Maritime Continent terrain and large-scale transient systems.The Maritime Continent topographic features strongly affect both the demarcation of the boreal summer and winter monsoon regimes and the asymmetric seasonal marches during the transition seasons. In the western part of the region, the complex interactions that lead to variability in deep convection are primarily controlled by the cold surges and the synoptic-scale Borneo vortex. The MaddenâJulian oscillation (MJO) reduces the frequency of weaker surges through an interference with their structure. It also influences convection, particularly on the diurnal cycle and when synoptic activities are weak. When both surges and the Borneo vortex are present, interactions between these circulations with the terrain can cause the strongest convection, which has included Typhoon Vamei (2001), which is the only observed tropical cyclone that developed within 1.5Â° of the equator.The cold surges are driven by midlatitude pressure rises associated with the movement of the Siberian high. Rapid strengthening of surge northeasterly winds can be explained as the tropical response via a geostrophic adjustment process to the pressure forcing in the form of an equatorial Rossby wave group. Dispersion of meridional modes leads to a northeastâsouthwest orientation that allows the surge to stream downstream through the similarly oriented South China Sea. This evolution leads to a cross-equatorial return flow and a cyclonic circulation at the equator, and thus a mechanism for equatorial cyclogenesis. Although the narrow width of the southern South China Sea facilitates strengthening of the cold surge, it also severely restricts the likelihood of cyclone development so that Vamei remains to be the only typhoon observed in the equatorial South China Sea.Climate variations from El NiÃ±oâSouthern Oscillation to climate change may impact the interactions between the large-scale motion and Maritime Continent terrain because they lead to changes in the mean flow. The thermodynamic effects on the interaction between MJO and the monsoon surges and Borneo vortex over the complex terrain also need to be addressed. These and other questions such as any possible changes in the likelihood of equatorial tropical cyclogenesis as a result of climate change are all important areas for future research. },

  Abstract                 = { Abstract Several studies have reported that Indonesian rainfall is poorly correlated with El NiÃ±oâSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) events during the northern winter wet monsoon season. This work studies the relationship between the NiÃ±o-3 (5Â°Sâ5Â°N, 150Â°â90Â°W) sea surface temperature (SST) and the Maritime Continent monsoon rainfall during 1979â2002. The study indicates that the correlations are mostly negative except in the vicinity of Sumatra and Malay Peninsula (SMP, including the western sections of Java and Borneo), where the correlations range from zero to weakly positive. The monsoon rainfall during ENSO events is influenced by a pair of anomalous Walker cells and a low-level closed circulation centered near the Philippines. East of SMP, the rainfall is negatively correlated with NiÃ±o-3 SST. The anomalous low-level wind over the Indian Ocean west of SMP causes rainfall to also be correlated negatively with NiÃ±o-3 SST, but rainfall over SMP is sheltered from this effect because of the high mountains along its western coast. The anomalous cross-equatorial flow associated with ENSO also affects the rainfall over SMP and the area to its east differently. A variation of the cross-equatorial flow may also contribute to the SMP rainfall anomaly. The result suggests that the previously reported low correlations between Indonesian monsoon rainfall and ENSO are due in part to the averaging of rainfall in two regions with opposite characteristics. The correlation is positive for Indonesia west of 112Â°E and negative to the east. There is also an interdecadal trend of increasingly negative correlations from 1950â78 to 1979â97. The correlation changes from significantly positive (at 1\%) to insignificant in western Indonesia and from insignificant to significantly negative in eastern Indonesia. },

  Abstract                 = { Abstract The development of a severe Hector thunderstorm that formed over the Tiwi Islands, north of Australia, during the Aerosol and Chemical Transport in Tropical Convection/Stratospheric-Climate Links with Emphasis on the Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere (ACTIVE/SCOUT-O3) field campaign in late 2005, is simulated by the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (ARW) model and the Met Office Unified Model (UM). The general aim of this paper is to investigate the role of isolated deep convection over the tropics in regulating the water content in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UT/LS). Using a horizontal resolution as fine as 1 km, the numerical simulations reproduce the timing, structure, and strength of Hector fairly well when compared with field campaign observations. The sensitivity of results from ARW to horizontal resolution is investigated by running the model in a large-eddy simulation mode with a horizontal resolution of 250 m. While refining the horizontal resolution to 250 m leads to a better representation of convection with respect to rainfall, the characteristics of the Hector thunderstorm are basically similar in space and time to those obtained in the 1-km-horizontal-resolution simulations. Several overshooting updrafts penetrating the tropopause are produced in the simulations during the mature stage of Hector. The penetration of rising towering cumulus clouds into the LS maintains the entrainment of air at the interface between the UT and the LS. Vertical exchanges resulting from this entrainment process have a significant impact on the redistribution of atmospheric constituents within the UT/LS region at the scale of the islands. In particular, a large amount of water is injected in the LS. The fate of the ice particles as Hector develops drives the water vapor mixing ratio to saturation by sublimation of the injected ice particles, moistening the air in the LS. The moistening was found to be fairly significant above 380 K and averaged about 0.06 ppmv in the range 380–420 K for ARW. As for UM, the moistening was found to be much larger (about 2.24 ppmv in the range of 380–420 K) than for ARW. This result confirms that convective transport can play an important role in regulating the water vapor mixing ratio in the LS. },

Service’s (DWD) non-hydrostatic Lokal-Modell (LM, COSMO-DE) with regard to dynamical-statistical
parameters and cloud properties. We propose a newly designed Dynamic State Index (DSI) to evaluate
precipitation processes. The DSI is presented in the context of a case study in the synoptic scale and in a
statistical approach. The DSI quantitatively describes the deviation from a stationary, adiabatic and reversible
solution of the primitive equations. As demonstrated by the example of the winter storm “Kyrill”, the analysis
of the vertical structure of the DSI gives a relation to the IPV-Thinking, introduced by Hoskins et al. (1985).
Furthermore, the DSI-pattern features the characteristic ﬁlament-like structure of rainbands with embedded
convective cells. In a next step the DSI is not only correlated with modelled precipitation but also with
observed precipitation as well as cloud types. The absolute value of the DSI shows moderate correlations
with hourly LM and high correlations with hourly COSMO-DE forecast data, based on 24 hour predictions.
The statistical analysis of clouds with the index reveals a DSI-threshold, which is used to introduce a novel
precipitation activity index of different cloud classes. In conclusion, the results highlight the importance of
dynamical processes for the generation of rainfall.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Recent approaches to crater detection have been inspired by face detection's use of gray-scale texture features. Using gray-scale texture features for supervised machine learning crater detection algorithms provides better classification of craters in planetary images than previous methods. When using Haar features it is typical to generate thousands of numerical values from each candidate crater image. This magnitude of image features to extract and consider can spell disaster when the application is an entire planetary surface. One solution is to reduce the number of features extracted and considered in order to increase accuracy as well as speed. Feature subset selection provides the operational classifiers with a concise and denoised set of features by reducing irrelevant and redundant features. Feature subset selection is known to be NP-hard. To provide an efficient suboptimal solution, four genetic algorithms are proposed to use greedy selection, weighted random selection, and simulated annealing to distinguish discriminate features from indiscriminate features. Inspired by analysis regarding the relationship between subset size and accuracy, a squeezing algorithm is presented to shrink the genetic algorithm's chromosome cardinality during the genetic iterations. A significant increase in the classification performance of a Bayesian classifier in crater detection using image texture features is observed.},

In order to have adequate sampling by the satellite, comparisons are made for 15Â° longitude Ã 10Â° latitude boxes and for larger geographical areas within the tropics. The temporally and spatially averaged hourly precipitation rates from CCM3 and from TRMM are fit to the diurnal harmonic by the method of linear least squares regression, and the phases and the amplitudes of the diurnal cycles are compared. The model's diurnal cycle is too strong over major land masses, particularly over South America (200% too large), and is too weak over many oceans, particularly the northwestern tropical Pacific (57% too small). The model-satellite phase differences tend to be more homogeneous. The peak in the model's diurnal harmonic consistently precedes that of the observations nearly everywhere. Phase differences are large over Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Saharan Africa, where CCM3 leads TRMM by 4 hours, 5 to 6 hours, and 9 to 11 hours, respectively. The model's phase and amplitude biases likely have effects on its hydrologic cycle and its surface and atmospheric energy budgets. Thus the causes for the model's biases need to be investigated.},

An idealized island is placed in the middle of a long, nonrotating channel oceanic domain with constant sea surface temperature. A strong diurnal cycle typical of a tropical island is simulated, with a thermally forced sea breeze in daytime and the associated inland propagation of precipitation. Offshore propagation of a land breeze and its associated convection is simulated every night but with varying extent. Gravity waves of first and second baroclinic modes trigger convection far from the coast if the offshore conditions are favorable. This accelerates the propagation speed of the land breeze as it reduces the onshore wind associated with the lower branch of the overturning large-scale circulation. Higher-order modes may trigger convection or reinforce existing convection but less systematically. The distance of propagation is particularly sensitive to humidity and temperature at the top of the boundary layer, with occasional incursions of a dry anomaly at the top of the boundary layer near the island preventing convection from developing far from the island.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A set of idealized convection-permitting simulations is performed to investigate the influence of topography on the physical mechanisms responsible for the nocturnal offshore propagation of convection around tropical islands. All simulations have an idealized island in the middle of a long channel oceanic domain, with constant sea surface temperature and without rotation. To diagnose the impact of topography, we compare a flat-island simulation with two simulations with mountain ranges of different shapes. The topography over the island has a strong impact on the diurnal cycle of convection as clouds tend to remain all day over the highest topography. This weakens the diurnal cycle and the land-breeze front, and triggers a comparatively less frequent long-distance offshore propagation of convection. As in the flat simulation, the distance of offshore propagation is particularly sensitive to humidity and temperature at the top of the boundary layer. A shallow circulation that is asymmetric with respect to the island influences the boundary-layer-top humidity and can favor propagation on one side of the island or the other. These results mimic cloud and precipitation patterns observed prior to the Madden-Julian Oscillation propagation over the Maritime Continent. The shape of the topography does not seem to influence the offshore propagation of convection significantly except for mountain-valley breezes that reinforce the land breeze and the establishment of the asymmetric shallow circulation.},

The parameterization approach is tested by implementing it in the framework of the Lorenz ’96 model. Performance of the parameterization scheme is assessed by inspecting probability distributions, correlation functions, and wave properties, and by carrying out ensemble forecasts. For the Lorenz ’96 model, the parameterization algorithm is shown to give good results with a Markov chain with a few states only and to outperform several other parameterization schemes.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Linear and nonlinear models are used to examine the development of island thunderstorms, in particular the Hector convective system that forms over the Tiwi Islands just north of Australia. The linear model is used to examine the flow response to an isolated, elliptical, heat source. It is found that the low-level convergence is maximized when the flow is weak and along the major axis of the heat source. A dry version of the nonlinear model verifies the trends predicted by the linear model except at very low flow speeds where the convergence is bounded in the nonlinear model but increases indefinitely in the linear model. Deep convection develops over the heat source when a moisture profile with positive convective available potential energy (CAPE) is added to the nonlinear model. The sensitivity of the convective strength (defined by the accumulated rainfall and total condensate) to wind speed and direction, surface fluxes, and low-level moisture is then examined. It is shown that the strength increases as the wind speed decreases and as the wind direction turns toward the major axis of the island, in agreement with the prediction of increased low-level convergence from the linear and nonlinear dry models. Sensitivity experiments indicate that the convective strength increases as both the heat and moisture fluxes increase. The strength is more sensitive to the heat flux since this drives the large-scale convergence and sea breezes that generate convection. As the low-level moisture in the upstream sounding increases, the accumulated rainfall over the islands increases monotonically; however, the total condensate reaches a maximum at a CAPE of around 1500 J kg−1 and then decreases thereafter. It is shown that the low-level moisture is an important predictor of the form of convective development. Finally, simulations with a single coastline are performed to show that one of the reasons the Hector convective system is so strong is that it develops over an island where the land–sea circulation from all coastlines can contribute.},

Individual updrafts, defined as 3D objects with vertical velocity above 10 m s−1 are identified. Among the 20 000 updrafts formed during the most intense phase, only a dozen were more than 4 km tall. The two tallest updrafts accounted for more than 90\% of the total vertical mass flux through the tropical tropopause layer. Their locations were determined by low-level convergence lines first created by the sea breeze in the morning, then enhanced by cold pools due to cumulus congestus. They finally reinforced each other as they moved inland and intersected. The two tallest updrafts that overshot the tropopause were contrasted with those occurring 1 h earlier and later. They presented larger widths (up to 8 km), greater buoyancy (up to 0.1 m s−2), stronger vertical velocities (up to 50 m s−1), and larger hydrometeor contents (more than 10 g kg−1). They kept their core weakly diluted on their way to the stratosphere with an entrainment rate as low as 0.08 km−1. Both the low-level convergence lines intensified by cold pools and the reduced mixing in the troposphere were found to be the determinant for the transition from deep to very deep convection. },

  Abstract                 = {AbstractThe overturning of Hector the Convector, a tropical multicellular convective system of northern Australia that regularly overshoots into the stratosphere, is synthesized at the scale of a large-eddy simulation. The isentropic analysis offers the advantage of filtering out the reversible motions due to gravity waves and taking into account the turbulent fluxes that contribute to the vertical transport. Two key circulations are characterized: the troposphere deep overturning and the mass exchange due to the overshoots into the stratosphere. The transition from deep to very deep convection is associated with a change in the diabatic tendency inside the tallest updrafts: the latent heat release due to the formation of a large amount of icy hydrometeors exceeds the loss of energy due to mixing with the drier, colder air of the environment. In agreement with a previous study of Hector examining the properties of its two tallest updrafts, the entrainment rate exhibits a minimum during the very deep convection phase as low as 0.04 km−1. The overturning intensity corroborates the Eulerian computation of the vertical mass flux in the midtroposphere and in the lower stratosphere. It however gives a lower estimate of the flux in the upper troposphere, filtering out the reversible motions, and a larger estimate in the lower troposphere and at the tropopause, where slow vertical motions contribute significantly to the transport.},

  Abstract                 = {A persistent problem for numerical weather and climate models is the representation of tropical convective precipitation which for the most part occurs on spatial and temporal scales too small and too short to be explicitly resolved. Given that model parameterizations represent this subgrid convection as a function of the large-scale atmospheric state, an understanding of the strongest relationships between the two scales is needed. This study introduces a method to create two concurrent long-term data sets that describe both the large-scale atmosphere and the characteristics of the small-scale convection. Important relationships between these two scales are then investigated. It is found that convective precipitation, through convective precipitation area, has the strongest relationship with dynamical variables such as moisture convergence and vertical velocity at midlevels. The magnitude of the fluctuations of convective strength about the mean is found to be anticorrelated with the strength of the large-scale variables, indicating a more stochastic behavior of tropical convection in weakly than strongly forced regimes, respectively. Atmospheric stability related variables are not found to be positively related to either convective precipitation area or convective precipitation intensity, which is often an assumption made in convective parameterization. On the contrary, in a more unstable atmosphere, there is lower convective precipitation.},

  Abstract                 = {The poor representation of tropical convection in general circulation models (GCMs) is believed to be responsible for much of the uncertainty in the predictions of weather and climate in the tropics. The stochastic multicloud model (SMCM) was recently developed by Khouider et al. (Commun Math Sci 8(1):187--216, 2010) to represent the missing variability in GCMs due to unresolved features of organized tropical convection. The SMCM is based on three cloud types (congestus, deep and stratiform), and transitions between these cloud types are formalized in terms of probability rules that are functions of the large-scale environment convective state and a set of seven arbitrary cloud timescale parameters. Here, a statistical inference method based on the Bayesian paradigm is applied to estimate these key cloud timescales from the Giga-LES dataset, a 24-h large-eddy simulation (LES) of deep tropical convection (Khairoutdinov et al. in J Adv Model Earth Syst 1(12), 2009) over a domain comparable to a GCM gridbox. A sequential learning strategy is used where the Giga-LES domain is partitioned into a few subdomains, and atmospheric time series obtained on each subdomain are used to train the Bayesian procedure incrementally. Convergence of the marginal posterior densities for all seven parameters is demonstrated for two different grid partitions, and sensitivity tests to other model parameters are also presented. A single column model simulation using the SMCM parameterization with the Giga-LES inferred parameters reproduces many important statistical features of the Giga-LES run, without any further tuning. In particular it exhibits intermittent dynamical behavior in both the stochastic cloud fractions and the large scale dynamics, with periods of dry phases followed by a coherent sequence of congestus, deep, and stratiform convection, varying on timescales of a few hours consistent with the Giga-LES time series. The chaotic variations of the cloud area fractions were captured fairly well both qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrating the stochastic nature of convection in the Giga-LES simulation.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract In continental convective environments, general circulation models typically produce a diurnal cycle of rainfall that peaks close to the noon maximum of insolation, hours earlier than the observed peak. One possible reason is insufficient sensitivity of their cumulus parameterizations to the state of the environment due to weak entrainment. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, run at cloud-resolving (600 and 125 m) resolution, is used to study the diurnal transition from shallow to deep convection during the monsoon break period of the Tropical Warm Pool–International Cloud Experiment. The WRF model develops a transition from shallow to deep convection in isolated events by 1430–1500 local time. The inferred entrainment rate weakens with increasing time of day as convection deepens. Several current cumulus parameterizations are tested for their ability to reproduce the WRF behavior. The Gregory parameterization, in which entrainment rate varies directly with parcel buoyancy and inversely as the square of the updraft speed, is the best predictor of the inferred WRF entrainment profiles. The Gregory scheme depends on a free parameter that represents the fraction of buoyant turbulent kinetic energy generation on the cloud scale that is consumed by the turbulent entrainment process at smaller scales. A single vertical profile of this free parameter, increasing with height above the boundary layer but constant with varying convection depth, produces entrainment rate profiles consistent with those inferred from the WRF over the buoyant depth of the convection. Parameterizations in which entrainment varies inversely with altitude or updraft speed or increases with decreasing tropospheric relative humidity do not perform as well. Entrainment rate at cloud base decreases as convection depth increases; this behavior appears to be related to an increase in vertical velocity at downdraft cold pool edges. },

  Abstract                 = { AbstractThe representation of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) is still a challenge for numerical weather prediction and general circulation models (GCMs) because of the inadequate treatment of convection and the associated interactions across scales by the underlying cumulus parameterizations. One new promising direction is the use of the stochastic multicloud model (SMCM) that has been designed specifically to capture the missing variability due to unresolved processes of convection and their impact on the large-scale flow. The SMCM specifically models the area fractions of the three cloud types (congestus, deep, and stratiform) that characterize organized convective systems on all scales. The SMCM captures the stochastic behavior of these three cloud types via a judiciously constructed Markov birth–death process using a particle interacting lattice model. The SMCM has been successfully applied for convectively coupled waves in a simplified primitive equation model and validated against radar data of tropical precipitation. In this work, the authors use for the first time the SMCM in a GCM. The authors build on previous work of coupling the High-Order Methods Modeling Environment (HOMME) NCAR GCM to a simple multicloud model. The authors tested the new SMCM-HOMME model in the parameter regime considered previously and found that the stochastic model drastically improves the results of the deterministic model. Clear MJO-like structures with many realistic features from nature are reproduced by SMCM-HOMME in the physically relevant parameter regime including wave trains of MJOs that organize intermittently in time. Also one of the caveats of the deterministic simulation of requiring a doubling of the moisture background is not required anymore. },

  Abstract                 = { AbstractIt is widely recognized that stratiform heating contributes significantly to tropical rainfall and to the dynamics of tropical convective systems by inducing a front-to-rear tilt in the heating profile. Precipitating stratiform anvils that form from deep convection play a central role in the dynamics of tropical mesoscale convective systems. The wide spreading of downdrafts that are induced by the evaporation of stratiform rain and originate from in the lower troposphere strengthens the recirculation of subsiding air in the neighborhood of the convection center and triggers cold pools and gravity currents in the boundary layer, leading to further lifting. Here, aquaplanet simulations with a warm pool–like surface forcing, based on a coarse-resolution GCM of approximately 170-km grid mesh, coupled with a stochastic multicloud parameterization, are used to demonstrate the importance of stratiform heating for the organization of convection on planetary and intraseasonal scales. When the model parameters, which control the heating fraction and decay time scale of the stratiform clouds, are set to produce higher stratiform heating, the model produces low-frequency and planetary-scale MJO-like wave disturbances, while parameters associated with lower-to-moderate stratiform heating yield mainly synoptic-scale convectively coupled Kelvin-like waves. Furthermore, it is shown that, when the effect of stratiform downdrafts is reduced in the model, the MJO-scale organization is weakened, and a transition to synoptic-scale organization appears despite the use of larger stratiform heating parameters. Rooted in the stratiform instability, it is conjectured here that the strength and extent of stratiform downdrafts are key contributors to the scale selection of convective organizations, perhaps with mechanisms that are, in essence, similar to those of mesoscale convective systems. },

  Abstract                 = { Abstract Recent experiences with tropical meteorology around the world have brought to light the frequent existence of a zonal band of west winds in the vicinity of the equator, which appears not to be associated with the westerlies of middle latitudes, but which rather seems to be found between the trades of the two hemispheres. The boundaries of the equatorial westerlies are usually characterized by increased cloudiness and poor weather. In this paper an attempt is made to prove that the westerlies of equatorial regions are not simply transitory phenomena but instead should be considered as an integral part of the normal general circulation of the atmosphere. Seasonal variation of the latitude of maximum insolation is the factor introduced to explain the existence of the west winds. A second explanatory theory is discussed in which radiation from the cloud tops of the âintertropical convergence zoneâ locally reverses the equatorial solenoidal field to produce two new lines of convergence, one on each side of the equator. The same theory is the basis for a discussion of the rather complex structure of the intertropical convergence zones in each of which multiple lines of cloud build-ups are frequently observed. The paper also points out that the polar front is not to be identified with the high latitude zone of low pressure that appears in general circulation schemes, but rather that the front lies well equatorward from the low pressure zone as a result of topographical irregularities which, in turn, cause traveling disturbances, the low pressure centers of which fall well within the cold air on the poleward side of the statistical latitude of the polar front. },

  Abstract                 = {Within the tropics, and during the summer months in midlatitudes, most of the rainfall reaching the surface is generated by moist convection. Over land, the diurnal cycle in moist convective rainfall usually peaks in the late afternoon. In most climate models, the diurnal peak in convective rainfall occurs several hours too early and is often near local solar noon. We argue that this bias partly originates from the methods used in convective parameterizations to calculate the cloud base mass flux. In most convective parameterizations, the initial convective mass flux is determined from the convective available potential energy (CAPE) of an updraft parcel originating from the model layer closest to the surface. In models, the rapid increase in the CAPE of this near-surface layer following sunrise contributes to a rapid increase in convective precipitation. However, the mass-weighted CAPE of the boundary layer as a whole responds much more slowly to the increase in downward solar radiation at the surface. Using a recently developed convective parameterization in version 4 of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM4), we show that the overall accuracy in the diurnal simulation of convective precipitation increases as the number of near-surface layers from which convective air parcels are permitted to originate increases from one to four. We also show that the simulation of the diurnal cycle in convective precipitation over land can be improved through the introduction of variables which attempt to represent the persistence of subgrid-scale convective organization within a grid column across model time steps.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In earlier work, a three-dimensional cloud model was used to simulate the interaction between the sea-breeze front (SBF) and front-parallel horizontal convective rolls (HCRs), resulting in the SBF systematically encountering roll updrafts and downdrafts as it progressed inland. Interestingly, deep convection was spawned above an HCR updraft ahead of the SBF as the front approached, well before the inevitable frontâroll merger. Ostensibly, both the sea-breeze and roll circulations were required for deep convection to be present in this case at all because convection was entirely absent when either phenomenon was removed. Further analysis reveals why both circulations were necessary yet not sufficient for the excitation of deep convection in this case. The sea-breeze circulation (SBC) made its upstream (inland) environment more favorable for convection by bringing about persistent if gentle lifting over an extended region stretching well ahead of the SBF. This persistent ascent established a moist and cool tongue of air, manifested by a visible and/or subvisible cloud feature termed the cloud shelf emanating ahead of the front. Though this lifting moistened and destabilized the environment, the rollâs direct and indirect effects on this moist tongue were also required. The former consisted of a moisture plume lofted by the roll updraft, and the latter consisted of obstacle effect gravity waves generated as the roll drafts penetrated through the top of the boundary layer, into the SBC-associated offshore flow farther aloft. These provided the missing spark, which led to rapid growth of cumulus above the roll updraft, drawing first from air located above the boundary layer. Once established, deep convection above the roll updraft modulated cloudiness above the approaching SBF, at first suppressing it but subsequently assuring its reestablishment and eventual growth into deep convection, again prior to the frontâroll merger. This resulted from the influence of gravity waves excited owing to heating and cooling within the roll cloud.},

  Abstract                 = {AbstractThe variation of precipitation over land due to the diurnal cycle of solar heating is examined here in the context of a simple multicloud model for tropical convection with bulk atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) dynamics. The model utilizes three cloud types (congestus, deep, and stratiform) that are believed to characterize organized tropical convection based on the first two baroclinic modes of vertical structure in the free troposphere, coupled to the ABL through full bulk boundary layer (FBBL) dynamics, that allow a careful separation between sensible and latent heat surface fluxes. In a land parameter regime, characterized by a strong inversion profile, a large Bowen ratio of 0.4, and active mixing of sensible heat due to cumulus entrainment and downdraft fluxes at the top of the ABL, the model supports a stable 1-day periodic solution that is characterized by a pronounced (7 K day?1) afternoon peak in precipitation consistent with observations of tropical precipitation over continental regions. The current study suggests a division of the diurnal cycle of precipitation over land into a cycle of five phases: 1) an overnight phase of a radiative?convective equilibrium (RCE) state between 2000 and 0600 LST; 2) an early morning CAPE buildup accompanied by a sudden rise in precipitation that quickly dries the middle troposphere occurs between 0600 and roughly 1000 LST; 3) a moistening phase between roughly 1000 and 1600 LST; 4) a phase of maximum precipitation between 1600 and 1800 LST that dries the middle troposphere and quickly consumes CAPE; and 5) a rapid remoistening phase that restores the moisture level to sustain the overnight RCE precipitation and connects to phase 1 in the cycle. Sensitivity tests in the model confirm that the late afternoon precipitation maximum over land depends crucially on a strong inversion, the large Bowen ratio, and the active mixing of sensible heat due to cumulus entrainment and downdraft fluxes at the top of the ABL.

  Abstract                 = {Despite recent advances in supercomputing, current general circulation models poorly represent the variability associated with organized tropical convection. In a recent study, the authors have shown, in the context of a paradigm two baroclinic mode system, that a stochastic multicloud convective parameterization based on three cloud types (congestus, deep and stratiform) can be used to improve the variability and the dynamical structure of tropical convection. Here, the stochastic multicloud model is modified with a lag type stratiform closure and augmented with an explicit mechanism for congestus detrainment moistening. These modifications improve the representation of intermittent coherent structures such as synoptic and mesoscale convective systems. Moreover, the new stratiform-lag closure allows for increased robustness of the coherent features of the model with respect to the amount of stochastic noise and leading to a multi-scale organization of slowly moving waves envelopes in which short-lived and chaotic convective events persist. Congestus cloud decks dominate the suppressed-dry phase of the wave envelopes. The simulations with the new closure have a higher amount of stochastic noise and result in a Walker type circulation with realistic mean and coherent variability which surpasses results of previous deterministic and stochastic multicloud models in the same parameter regime. Further, deterministic mean field limit equations (DMFLE) for the stochastic multicloud model are considered. Aside from providing a link to the deterministic multicloud parameterization, the DMFLE allow a judicious way of determining the amount of deterministic and stochastic ``chaos'' in the system. It is shown that with the old stratiform heating closure, the stochastic process accounts for most of the chaotic behavior. The simulations with the new stratiform heating closure exhibit a mixture of stochastic and deterministic chaos. The highly chaotic dynamics in the simulations with congestus detrainment mechanism is due to the strongly nonlinear and numerically stiff deterministic dynamics. In the latter two cases, the DMFLE can be viewed as a ``standalone'' parameterization, which is capable of capturing some dynamical features of the stochastic parameterization. Furthermore, it is shown that, in spatially extended simulations, the stochastic multicloud model can capture qualitatively two local statistical features of the observations: long and short auto-correlation times of moisture and precipitation, respectively and the approximate power-law in the probability density of precipitation event size for large precipitation events. The latter feature is not reproduced in the column simulations. This fact underscores the importance of gravity waves and large scale moisture convergence.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite recent advances in supercomputing, current general circulation models (GCMs) poorly represent the variability associated with organized tropical convection. A stochastic multicloud convective parameterization based on three cloud types (congestus, deep, and stratiform), introduced recently by Khouider, Biello, and Majda in the context of a single column model, is used here to study flows above the equator without rotation effects. The stochastic model dramatically improves the variability of tropical convection compared to the conventional moderate- and coarse-resolution paradigm GCM parameterizations. This increase in variability comes from intermittent coherent structures such as synoptic and mesoscale convective systems, analogs of squall lines and convectively coupled waves seen in nature whose representation is improved by the stochastic parameterization. Furthermore, simulations with a sea surface temperature (SST) gradient yield realistic mean Walker cell circulation with plausible high variability. An additional feature of the present stochastic parameterization is a natural scaling of the model from moderate to coarse grids that preserves the variability and statistical structure of the coherent features. These results systematically illustrate, in a paradigm model, the benefits of using the stochastic multicloud framework to improve deterministic parameterizations with clear deficiencies.},

  Abstract                 = { AbstractOne event of a tropical thunderstorm typically observed in northern Australia, known as Hector, is investigated using high-resolution model output from the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU–NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM5) observations from a ground-based weather radar located in Berrimah (Australia) and data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. The analysis is carried out by tracking the full life cycle of Hector from prestorm stage to the decaying stage. In both the prestorm stage, characterized by nonprecipitating cells, and the triggering stage, when the Hector storm is effectively initiated, an analysis is performed with the aid of high-spatial-and-temporal-resolution MM5 output and the Berrimah ground-based radar imagery. During the mature (“old”) stage of Hector, considering the conceptual model for tropical convection suggested by R. Houze, TRMM Microwave Imager satellite-based data were added to ground-based radar data to analyze the storm vertical structure (dynamics, thermodynamics, and hydrometeor contents). Model evaluation with respect to observations (radar reflectivity and TRMM data) suggests that MM5 performed fairly well in reproducing the dynamics of Hector, providing support to the assertion that the strength of convection, in terms of vertical velocity, largely contributes to the vertical distribution of hydrometeors. Moreover, the stages of the storm and its vertical structure display good agreement with Houze’s aforementioned conceptual model. Finally, it was found that the most important triggering mechanisms for this Hector event are topography, the sea breeze, and a gust front produced by previous convection. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract On 2 July 2016 afternoon a heavy rainfall (52.8 mm) was observed over southwestern part of Armenia, at Talin station. High-frequency radar observations and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model output show that initiation of earliest convection occurred over Aragats mountain massif around noon due to low-level convergence of thermally induced upslope winds. Further convective development was affected by generation of secondary convection as a result of interaction between cold pool outflows from developed convective cells and upslope winds. The high-resolution WRF run (3 km) using NSSL two-moment cloud microphysics parametrization and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts operational model forcing data best reproduces the location, timing, magnitude, and microphysical structure of the observed convective rainfall among six WRF microphysical schemes tested in this study. Radar observations show that cold cloud process typical for continental-type deep convection was observed in Armenia. The NSSL includes the double-moment microphysics schemes for both warm and cold cloud processes, which might be a reason for improved simulation of observed heavy rainfall event in Armenia. Using the coarser resolution ERA5 analysis forcing data in the WRF model leads to simulation of earlier rainfall peaks at Talin station and spurious convective rainfall areas. The WRF model forced by the Global Data Assimilation System Final analysis from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, even run at 3-km resolution, is not able to reproduce the accurate location of convection and rainfall over the study area.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple analytic model is constructed to elucidate some basic features of the response of the tropical atmosphere to diabatic heating. In particular, there is considerable east-west asymmetry which can be illustrated by solutions for heating concentrated in an area of finite extent. This is of more than academic interest because heating in practice tends to be concentrated in specific areas. For instance, a model with heating symmetric about the equator at Indonesian longitudes produces low-level easterly flow over the Pacific through propagation of Kelvin waves into the region. It also produces low-level westerly inflow over the Indian Ocean (but in a smaller region) because planetary waves propagate there. In the heating region itself the low-level flow is away from the equator as required by the vorticity equation. The return flow toward the equator is farther west because of planetary wave propagation, and so cyclonic flow is obtained around lows which form on the western margins of the heating zone. Another model solution with the heating displaced north of the equator provides a flow similar to the monsoon circulation of July and a simple model solution can also be found for heating concentrated along an inter-tropical convergence line.},

To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study on the probability density function of entrainment rate, the relationships between entrainment rate and cloud microphysics, and the effects of dry air sources on the calculated entrainment rate in deep convection from an observational perspective. Results show that the probability density function of entrainment rate can be well fitted by lognormal, gamma or Weibull distribution, with coefficients of determination being 0.82, 0.85 and 0.80, respectively. Entrainment tends to reduce temperature, water vapor content and moist static energy in cloud due to evaporative cooling and dilution. Inspection of the relationships between entrainment rate and microphysical properties reveals a negative correlation between volume-mean radius and entrainment rate, suggesting the potential dominance of homogeneous mechanism in the clouds examined. In addition, entrainment rate and environmental water vapor content show similar tendencies of variation with the distance of the assumed environmental air to the cloud edges. Their variation tendencies are non-monotonic due to the relatively short distance between adjacent clouds.},

Intensive studies have focused on the duration and strength of sea and land breezes and the development of small-scale systems controlled by the irregular coastline in the study area. The internal dynamics of the land breeze and the occurrence of temperature variations in the coastal area are discussed as well as the interrelationship between these factors.The studies show that the sea and land breezes are well developed when the synoptic-scale pressure gradient is relatively weak. However, a division into smaller systems has been observed, i.e. small islands outside the coastline develop their own wind systems. In the archipelago, a primary sea breeze with no interaction with the main coastline develops during the first hours after sunrise. The primary sea breeze continues to act until a stronger sea breeze, developed in interaction with the main coastline, begins to blow. This phenomenon was not observed for the land breeze. Here, no general land breeze develops, instead a breeze was recorded which always blew towards the coastline.},

Comparing the simulated storms on these days with the Met Office rainfall radar network allows us to apply a statistical approach to evaluate the properties and evolution of the simulated storms over a range of conditions. Here we present results comparing the storm morphology in the model and reality which show that the simulated storms become smaller as grid length decreases and that the grid length that fits the observations best changes with the size of the observed cells. We investigate the sensitivity of storm morphology in the model to the mixing length used in the subgrid turbulence scheme. As the subgrid mixing length is decreased, the number of small storms with high area-averaged rain rates increases. We show that, by changing the mixing length, we can produce a lower-resolution simulation which produces similar morphologies to a higher-resolution simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {A stochastic model of climate variability is considered in which slow changes of climate are explained as the integral response to continuous random excitation by short period “weather” disturbances. The coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-land system is divided into a rapidly varying “weather” system (essentially the atmosphere) and a slowly responding “climate” system (the ocean, cryosphere, land vegetation, etc.). In the usual Statistical Dynamical Model (SDM) only the average transport effects of the rapidly varying weather components are parameterised in the climate system. The resultant prognostic equations are deterministic, and climate variability can normally arise only through variable external conditions. The essential feature of stochastic climate models is that the non-averaged “weather” components are also retained. They appear formally as random forcing terms. The climate system, acting as an integrator of this short-period excitation, exhibits the same random-walk response characteristics as large particles interacting with an ensemble of much smaller particles in the analogous Brownian motion problem. The model predicts “red” variance spectra, in qualitative agreement with observations. The evolution of the climate probability distribution is described by a Fokker-Planck equation, in which the effect of the random weather excitation is represented by diffusion terms. Without stabilising feedback, the model predicts a continuous increase in climate variability, in analogy with the continuous, unbounded dispersion of particles in Brownian motion (or in a homogeneous turbulent fluid). Stabilising feedback yields a statistically stationary climate probability distribution. Feedback also results in a finite degree of climate predictability, but for a stationary climate the predictability is limited to maximal skill parameters of order 0.5.DOI: 10.1111/j.2153-3490.1976.tb00696.x},

Dry season rainfall anomalies are spatially coherent, strongly correlated with SST, and tightly coupled to El NiÃ±o?Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variations in the Pacific basin. Drought conditions typically occur during El NiÃ±o, when SSTs surrounding Indonesia are cool and the Walker circulation is weakened, resulting in anomalous surface easterlies across Indonesia. The opposite tends to occur during La NiÃ±a. Broadscale Indonesian rainfall and SST anomalies tend to not persist from the dry season into the wet season. Rainfall in the heart of the wet season tends to be uncorrelated with SST and spatially incoherent. Seasonally varying feedback between Indonesian SST, winds, and rainfall explains the growth, persistence, and coherence of the local anomalies during the dry season and their decay or change in sign once the wet season commences. During the dry season anomalous surface easterlies, remotely driven by warm SSTs in the central Pacific during El NiÃ±o, act to increase local wind speed, cooling the ocean surrounding and to the east of Indonesia and thereby increasing the anomalous SST gradient across the Pacific. Hence, local rainfall and the Walker circulation are further reduced. Once the wet season commences and the climatological surface winds across Indonesia shift from southeasterly to northwesterly, the anomalous surface easterlies now act to reduce the wind speed. The initial cold SST anomaly is damped, reducing the negative rainfall anomalies and surface easterlies. The opposite scenario occurs during La NiÃ±a. Indonesian rainfall variations during the dry season are also coupled to the development of an anomalous zonal SST gradient in the equatorial Indian Ocean. This anomalous gradient is strongly related to ENSO and is most prominent during the dry season. Once the wet season commences, the entire Indian Ocean tends to have the same-signed SST anomaly (positive during El NiÃ±o and negative during La NiÃ±a). Development and decay of this anomalous zonal SST gradient in the Indian Ocean is promoted by seasonally varying air?sea interaction in the eastern Indian Ocean in response to ENSO conditions in the Pacific. The eastern Indian Ocean SST changes are driven largely by induced surface heat flux variations (primarily changes in latent heat flux and net shortwave radiation). Biennial variations in the Indonesian region may also be induced by this seasonally varying air?sea interaction associated with ENSO.

  Abstract                 = {The diurnal wind variation over the East Asian continent is commonly considered to be a combination of a land-sea breeze near the coast and a mountainâvalley breeze along the slopes of the Tibetan Plateau. The local landâsea breeze along the coastline typically spans < 100 km into the ocean. However, a detailed examination of the global reanalysis data suggests that this local landâsea breeze circulation apparently couples with the global-scale diurnal atmospheric pressure tide to produce a planetary-scale landâsea breeze with a spatial scale of â¼1000 km over the western North Pacific. Computations of the momentum budget and equivalent potential temperatures indicate that the atmospheric diurnal tidal wave contributes the most to this circulation feature. A diagnosis of the water vapour budget further suggests that the convergence of water vapour flux, which is related to the convergence of low-level wind induced by the seasonal change of diurnal tidal wave, leads to different times of occurrence of maximum diurnal rainfall over East Asia between summer and winter.

  Abstract                 = {Land–sea breezes (LSBs) induced by diurnal differential heating are examined using a three-dimensional linear model employing fast Fourier transform with emphasis on the complex coastline shape and geometry, the earth’s rotation, and background wind effects. It has been demonstrated that the low-level vertical motion associated with LSB can be significantly enhanced over a bay (peninsula) because of convergence of perturbations induced by differential heating along a seaward concave (convex) coastline. The dependence of surface winds and vertical motion patterns and their evolutions on the coastline geometries such as the width and the aspect ratio of the bay, the earth’s rotation, and the background winds are investigated.

The LSB induced by an isolated tropical island is characterized by onshore flow and ascent over the island in the afternoon to early evening, with a reversal of direction from midnight to early morning. The diurnal heating–induced vertical motion is greatly enhanced over the island and weakened offshore because of the convergence and divergence of perturbations. In the presence of background flow, stronger diurnal perturbations are found at the downwind side of the island, which can extend far downstream associated with inertia–gravity waves.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract It has long been known that trade wind cumulus and deep cumulonimbus represent primary components of the broad spectrum of cumulus clouds in the Tropics, which has led to the concept of a bimodal distribution of tropical clouds. However, recent analyses of shipboard radar data from Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) provide evidence of abundant populations of a third cloud type, cumulus congestus. Congestus clouds constitute over half the precipitating convective clouds in COARE and contribute over one-quarter of the total convective rainfall. Global Atmospheric Research Program Atlantic Tropical Experiment studies reveal a similar midlevel peak in the distribution of radar-echo tops. These findings lead to the conclusion that shallow cumulus, congestus, and cumulonimbus are all prominent tropical cumulus cloud types. They are associated with trimodal distributions of divergence, cloud detrainment, and fractional cloudiness in the Tropics. The peaks in the distributions of radar-echo tops for these three cloud types are in close proximity to prominent stable layers that exist over the Pacific warm pool and the tropical eastern Atlantic: near 2 km (the trade stable layer), ∼5 km (near 0°C), and ∼15–16 km (the tropopause). These stable layers are inferred to inhibit cloud growth and promote cloud detrainment. The 0°C stable layer can produce detrainment from cumulonimbi (attendant shelf clouds) and help retard the growth of precipitation-laden and strongly entraining congestus clouds. Moreover, restriction of growth of congestus clouds to just above the 0°C level limits further enhancement of cloud buoyancy through glaciation. The three cloud types are found to vary significantly during COARE on the timescale of the 30–60-day intraseasonal oscillation. The specific roles of clouds of the congestus variety in the general circulation are not yet clear, but some (the shallower ones) contribute to moistening and preconditioning the atmosphere for deep convection; others (the deeper ones) contribute an important fraction of the total tropical rainfall, and both likely produce many midlevel clouds, thereby modulating the radiative heating of the tropical atmosphere. },

When they involved a small (or large) parameter the evolution occurs on two time scales. A general scheme is developed for extracting equations for the slow evolution, including higher order corrections. The scheme unifies the multifarious methods that exist in the literature. It leads to a subdivision in three categories, determined by the structure of the equations. Although linear equations are merely a specialization, they can readily be generalized to the case of linear partial differential equations, such as the so amply studied Fokker-Planck equation. These are treated with special attention to the definition of the required projection operator. Throughout, numerous examples and applications are given. },

This result is the underlying reason for the existence of “renormalized transport coefficients”. In chapter \{III\} the same treatment is adapted to nonlinear equations. In chapter \{IV\} an alternative treatment is described, applicable only in a special case, but not confined to small ατc. The emphasis is on physical usefulness rather than mathematical rigor.

  Abstract                 = {Convective initiation is a challenge for convection-permitting models due to its sensitivity to sub-km processes. We evaluate the representation of convective storms and their initiation over South Africa during four summer months in Met Office Unified Model simulations at a 1.5-km horizontal grid length. Storm size distributions from the model compare well with radar observations, but rainfall in the model is predominantly produced by large storms (50?km in diameter or larger) in the evening, whereas radar observations show that most rainfall occurs throughout the afternoon, from storms 10?50?km in diameter. In all months, the modelled maximum number of storm initiations occurs at least 2?hr prior to the radar-observed maximum. However, the diurnal cycle of rainfall between the model and observations compares well, suggesting that the numerous storm initiations in the simulations do not produce much rainfall. Modelled storms are generally less intense than those in radar observations, especially in early summer. In February, when tropical influences dominate, the simulated storms are of similar intensity to observed storms. Simulated storms tend to reach their peak intensity in the first 15?min after initiation, then gradually become less intense as they grow. In radar observations, storms reach their peak intensity 15?min into their life cycle, stay intense as they grow larger, then gradually weaken after they have reached their maximum diameter. Two November case studies of severe convection are analysed in detail. A higher resolution grid length initiates convection slightly earlier (300?m as opposed to 1.5?km) with the same scientific settings. Two 1.5 km simulations that apply more subgrid mixing have delayed convective initiation. Analysis of soundings indicates little difference in the convective indices, suggesting that differences in convection may be attributed to the choice of subgrid mixing parameters.},

The unique nature of regularly occurring storms over these islands enabled a study principally aimed at investigating the life cycle of island-initiated mesoscale convective systems within the Maritime Continent. The program objectives are first outlined and then selected results from various observationally based and modeling studies are summarized. These storms are shown to depend typically on island-scale forcing although external mesoscale disturbances can result in significant storm activity as they pass over the heated island. Particular emphasis is given to summarizing the environmental characteristics and the impact this has on the location of storm development and the associated rainfall distribution. The mean rainfall production from these storms is shown to be about 760 ? 105 m3, with considerable variability. The mesoscale evolution is summarized and during the rapid development phase the interaction of storms with preexisting convergence zones is highlighted. In situ microphysical observations show the occurrence of very large rain drops (up to 8-mm diameter) and very large concentrations of ice crystals in the ?10° to ?60°C temperature range associated with the very intense updrafts. Occurrence of graupel aloft is shown to be strongly linked to cloud to ground lightning. Polarimetric radar-based rainfall estimates using specific differential phase shift are shown to be considerably better than reflectivity based estimates. Studies relating to the structure of anvil cloud and the effect on the radiative heating profile are also summarized. Initial attempts at modeling storm development are also presented. Two different nonhydrostatic models on days with markedly different evolution are employed and indicate that the models show considerable promise in their ability to develop mesoscale systems. However, important differences still remain between observed storm evolution and that modeled.

  Abstract                 = {A stochastic model for representing the missing variability in global climate models due to unresolved features of organized tropical convection is presented here. We use a Markov chain lattice model to represent small scale convective elements which interact with each other and with the large scale environmental variables through convective available potential energy (CAPE) and middle troposphere dryness. Each lattice site is either occupied by a cloud of a certain type (congestus, deep or stratiform) or it is a clear sky site. The lattice sites are assumed to be independent from each other so that a coarse-grained stochastic birth-death system, which can be evolved with a very low computational overhead, is obtained for the cloud area fractions alone. The stochastic multicloud model is then coupled to a simple tropical climate model consisting of a system of ODEs, mimicking the dynamics over a single GCM grid box. Physical intuition and observations are employed here to constrain the design of the models. Numerical simulations showcasing some of the dynamical features of the coupled model are presented below.},

AbstractBasinwide convective anomalies over the Indian Ocean (IO) associated with the Madden?Julian oscillation (MJO) sometimes propagate eastward and reach the west Pacific (WP), but sometimes do not.

  Abstract                 = { Abstract Cloud systems over the Maritime Continent and the tropical western Pacific defined by the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) were tracked, and their evolution was compared with cloud parameters [e.g., minimum blackbody brightness temperature (TBB), cloud area size, TBB gradient at cloud edges]. In addition, cloud systems observed by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) were examined, and the relationship with precipitation was investigated. Analysis areas were divided into four regions: open ocean, coastal sea, coasts, and land. Cloud systems that did not split from or merge with other systems (28\% of a total of 290 717 cloud systems) showed common features on cloud parameters in spite of different lifetimes or their locations. While the minimum TBB appeared in the beginning of their lifetimes, the cloud area was still expanding. At the time of first detection, the TBB gradient at the edge of the cloud system was the maximum and decreased with time. The rain rate was maximized when the TBB was at a minimum or earlier. For example, a system with the lifetime of 5 h over the ocean has a minimum TBB 2 h after the occurrence, a maximum area at 3 h, a maximum TBB gradient at 1 h, and a maximum rain rate at 1 h. Vertical development was significant in coasts, while remarkable horizontal expansion appeared over land. In particular, precipitation ice and storm height profiles showed differences among regions. },

The resultant convective system is qualitatively similar to that observed. The modelled gravity waves propagate away from the cloud with wave-fronts that are approximately circular, implying that the convective clouds do not generate waves which propagate in a preferred direction. The gravity-wave generation is related to the oscillation of the convective updraughts about their level of neutral buoyancy. While the general features of the gravity waves are similar in most respects to a previous study which used an idealized wind profile, the frequency of the gravity waves is Doppler-shifted by the tropospheric wind shear. The result is a much broader power spectrum in comparison to the idealized cases.},

Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Climate models can exhibit systematic errors in their mean precipitation over the Maritime Continent of the Indonesian archipelago at the heart of the tropical warm pool. These can often be traced back to an erroneous simulation of the diurnal cycle, and can lead to errors in global climate, through planetary wave propagation. Here, we examine the simulation of the diurnal cycle over the Maritime Continent in a series of high-resolution integrations of the UK Met Office atmospheric model, with horizontal resolutions of 40 and 12 km (where the convection is parametrised) and 4 km (where the convection is explicitly resolved), as part of the Cascade project. In these models, the vertical heating profile over the islands changes from a convective profile with a mid-tropospheric maximum in the early afternoon to a more stratiform profile with upper-tropospheric heating and mid-tropospheric cooling later. The convective heating profile forces a first internal mode gravity wave that propagates rapidly offshore; the deep warm anomalies behind its downwelling wavefront suppress convection offshore during early afternoon. The stratiform heating profile forces a gravity wave with a higher-order vertical mode that propagates slowly offshore later in the afternoon. This mode has a negative, destabilising temperature anomaly in the mid-troposphere. Together with the convergence zone between the wave fronts of the two modes, favourable conditions are created for offshore convection. In the 4 km explicit convection model, the offshore convection responds strongly to this gravity wave forcing, in agreement with observations, supporting a gravity wave?convection paradigm for the diurnal cycle over the Maritime Continent. However, the convective response in the lower-resolution models is much less coherent, leading to errors in the diurnal cycle and mean precipitation. Hence, to improve climate model simulations, sensitivity to gravity wave forcing should be a factor in future convective parametrisation schemes. Copyright ? 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

  Abstract                 = {Systematic strategies from applied mathematics for stochastic modelling in climate are reviewed here. One of the topics discussed is the stochastic modelling of mid-latitude low-frequency variability through a few teleconnection patterns, including the central role and physical mechanisms responsible for multiplicative noise. A new low-dimensional stochastic model is developed here, which mimics key features of atmospheric general circulation models, to test the fidelity of stochastic mode reduction procedures. The second topic discussed here is the systematic design of stochastic lattice models to capture irregular and highly intermittent features that are not resolved by a deterministic parametrization. A recent applied mathematics design principle for stochastic column modelling with intermittency is illustrated in an idealized setting for deep tropical convection; the practical effect of this stochastic model in both slowing down convectively coupled waves and increasing their fluctuations is presented here.Keywords:},

  Abstract                 = {Nocturnal precipitation cells and lines occur near the coastline in the whole Mediterranean basin in all seasons. The precipitation events are mainly located in areas where coastal mountain ranges and rivers enhance convergence though the interaction of nocturnal mesoscale and local flows (land breeze, katabatic and drainages winds) with prevailing synoptic wind or with other mesoscale and local flows. The methodology used here to study this phenomenon consists of three stages. First, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) radar satellite database is used to detect nocturnal precipitation near the coastline, from 18 to 09 UTC. An event is included in the study if the 3 hours accumulated precipitation detected by TRMM is stationary near the coast, or has moved slightly onshore or offshore, and has lasted no more than six consecutive hours. Second, the NCEP reanalysis database is used to describe the synoptic conditions and to discard precipitation associated with synoptic events (large low pressure areas, dynamic polar fronts, or troughs, for example). In the final step by using the version 3 of the Weather Research Forecast model, we simulate and analyse some of the selected events to determine the role of the landâsea temperature differences, the curvature of the coastline and the sea surface temperature. The simulations confirm that the nocturnal precipitation studied in the Mediterranean basin near the coastline is formed from the interaction between relatively warm and wet sea-air with the cold air mass from drainage winds, as well as from the convergence of several drainage winds offshore. The mechanism is the same that is used to explain nocturnal precipitation in tropical areas.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract Various earlier studies have demonstrated that rainfall in the Maritime ContinentâIndonesia region is strongly related to the El NiÃ±oâSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) during the dry half of the year but has a very weak association with ENSO during the summerâwet season months. This relationship is investigated over a wider domain through the use of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data as a proxy for rainfall. Consistent with the hypothesis of Haylock and McBride, it is found that the large-scale structure of the low-order empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of OLR have a strong resemblance to the patterns of correlation between OLR and the Southern Oscillation index (SOI). This supports the hypothesis that the predictable component of rainfall is determined by the component that is spatially coherent, as quantified through EOF analysis. As was found earlier with rainfall, the region of largest correlation between interannual OLR anomalies and the SOI lies in the winter hemisphere. The predictable component of OLR (or rainfall) remains in the region of the Maritime Continent throughout the year and thus does not accompany the minimum OLR (maximum rainfall) during its annual interhemispheric progression as the major monsoon heat source. The sign of the OLRâSOI relationship is such that the Maritime Continent has increased rainfall during a La NiÃ±a or cold event. Patterns of correlation between sea surface temperature and the SOI show the existence of a region to the east of the Maritime Continent whereby sea surface temperature anomalies are positive during these (La NiÃ±a) conditions. This is in the sense of a direct relationship, that is, positive sea surface temperature anomalies corresponding to increased rainfall. The annual cycle of the sea surface temperature structure of ENSO is represented by the first EOF of the interannual sea surface temperature series for each separate calendar month. The region of the sea surface temperature anomaly giving the direct relationship with Maritime Continent rainfall is part of the âboomerang-shapedâ pattern that lies between and has the opposite sign from the anomalies in the eastern-central Pacific and the Indian Oceans. Besides being a fundamental component of the large-scale sea surface temperature structure of ENSO, the boomerang pattern goes through an annual cycle such that it has maximum amplitude in the winter hemisphere. This suggests that interannual variations of Maritime Continent rainfall are in direct response to upstream sea surface temperature anomalies in the ENSO boomerang pattern. },

The results show that the presence of a bay produces a landward distortion of the sea breeze convergence zone and that within the zone there develop definite extrema of vertical motion, the positions of which are closely related to the bay. Furthermore, the intensity of convergence and upward motion within the zone are distributed asymmetrically with respect to the bay. This is a result of the Coriolis acceleration and the bay-induced component of the pressure-gradient force acting in concert on one side of the bay and in opposition on the other.},

Cool marine air propagates inland when a cross-shore mesoscale (2‚Äì2000 km) pressure gradient is created by daytime differential heating. The circulation is also characterized by rising currents at the sea breeze front and diffuse sinking currents well out to sea and is usually closed by seaward flow aloft. Coastal impacts include relief from oppressive hot weather, development of thunderstorms, and changes in air quality. This paper provides a review of SBS research extending back 2500 years but focuses primarily on recent discoveries.

  Abstract                 = {An ellipse can be fit to an arbitrary shape using a linear least squares approach applied to boundary data. Alternatively, this problem can also be solved by calculating the second moments of the entire region, a technique popular in image analysis applications. If the irregular shape can be approximated by a polygon then Greens theorem allows efficient calculation of the second moments. If the shape is pixelated then the second moments can be calculated by a simple summation process. By considering the behaviour of these fitting methods with increasing deformation it is shown that as an arbitrary shape passively deforms, the best-fit ellipse also behaves as if it were deforming passively. This implies that all techniques of strain analysis that were previously restricted to populations of elliptical objects may now be applied to populations of arbitrary shapes, provided the best-fit ellipse is calculated by one of the methods described here. Furthermore it implies that selective sampling based on shape or methods of weighting based upon shape are invalid and tend to bias the raw data.},

  Abstract                 = {Characteristics of sea breeze circulations over a tropical Indian station have been studied, based on one year of observations, by Doppler Sound Detection and Ranging (SODAR) system at National Atmospheric Research Laboratory, Gadanki (13.5¬∞N, 79.2¬∞E), India. The effect of sea breeze circulations on the dynamics of low level flow patterns in atmospheric boundary layer over complex terrain in tropics is investigated. The study reveals that a sea-breeze front develops well along the eastern coastal plain of southern peninsular India and propagates over inland up to the distance about 80&#xa0;km. It is found that the sea-breeze signal is well recognized during the months of February, March and April due to the presence of tropical easterlies. In these three months, \{SODAR\} observations indicate a late afternoon intensification of sea-breeze flow in the height range 0.2‚Äì0.6&#xa0;km during 1400 and 2000 local time (LT). The decrease in temperature of 2&#xa0;¬∞C and increase in relative humidity of 20% at surface level are observed on a sea breeze day as compared to a non-sea breeze day. Sea-breeze inland propagation is absent for the rest of the months due to the opposing meso-flow direction. ERA-Interim reanalysis U-velocity data over south-Asia grid also corroborates the deep-inland penetrations of sea breeze circulations over this site. },

  Abstract                 = {The Maritime Continent, with its complex system of islands and shallow seas, presents a major challenge to models, which tend to systematically underestimate the precipitation in this region. Experiments with a climate version of the Met Office model (HadAM3) show that even with a threefold increase in horizontal resolution there is no improvement in the dry bias. It is argued that the diurnal cycle over the islands and the complex circulation patterns generated by land–sea contrasts are crucial for the energy and hydrological cycles of the Maritime Continent and for determining the mean climate. It is shown that the model has substantial errors in its simulation of the diurnal cycle over the islands, which can rectify onto the seasonal mean climate.
It is further argued that deficient rainfall over the Maritime Continent could be a driver for other systematic errors, such as the excess precipitation over the western Indian Ocean. To demonstrate the sensitivity of global systematic model errors to the heating in this region, two experiments have been performed, one with the existing distribution of islands and a second where the island grid points are replaced by ocean grid points. In the absence of the islands of the Maritime Continent, the local precipitation increases by 15%, reducing the existing dry bias and bringing the model closer to observations. In response to this improved heating distribution, precipitation decreases over the west Indian Ocean and South Pacific convergence zone, reducing the systematic wet bias in these regions. This supports the hypothesis that tropical systematic errors are often related through vertical (Walker) circulations.
The extratropical response to changes in the Maritime Continent heat source is also well demonstrated by these experiments. The enhanced heating and, hence, divergent outflow generates Rossby waves, which have a significant impact on the winter circulation and surface temperatures across much of North America and the northeast Eurasian region. These changes are such as to substantially reduce model systematic error in these regions. These results reinforce the critical role played by the Maritime Continent in the global circulation. It emphasizes the need for better representation of convective organization over regions of complex land–sea terrains and the importance of considering the global context of model systematic errors in which biases in the Tropics may be a key factor.},

  Abstract                 = {The late sea breeze (LSB), defined as a sea breeze with an onset time later than 1200 LST, and its impact on \{O3\} concentration distributions have been investigated both observationally and numerically over the Busan metropolitan area in Korea. The observed \{LSB\} mostly occurred under weak offshore synoptic flows during mid-day, and was found with late but apparent transitions in wind direction along with lower wind speed. The observed \{O3\} concentrations associated with the \{LSB\} demonstrated more significant enhancement of maximum \{O3\} concentrations than those of the early sea breeze by a factor of approximately 1.5. The main meteorological feature associated with the \{LSB\} was also reproduced by \{MM5\} for typical cases. The numerically derived backward trajectories suggested that the increase of \{O3\} at the coastal site is mainly due to recirculated polluted air mass. The numerical simulation of \{O3\} concentrations from MM5/UAM-V shows that offshore winds of northwesterly synoptic flow swept the precursors of \{O3\} that were emitted by the urban area toward the sea during the early morning. As the development of the \{LSB\} was suppressed by the synoptic flow, a large near-stagnant wind field formed over the sea with intense photochemical activity at mid-day. However, the subsequent \{LSB\} with low wind speed was simulated in order to slowly re-advect the photochemically produced air parcels toward the inland area, resulting in both a significant enhancement of \{O3\} concentrations and high concentrations over the coastal area lasting for relatively longer hours. This result implies that the \{LSB\} plays an important role in the recirculation/accumulation of \{O3\} concentrations over the Busan metropolitan area, Korea. },

  Abstract                 = {Two-year series of 1-min rainfall intensities observed by rain gages at six different points are analyzed to obtain information about the fractal behavior of the rainfall distribution in time. First, the rainfall time series are investigated using a monodimensional fractal approach (simple scaling) by calculating the box and correlation dimensions, respectively. The results indicate scaling but with different dimensions for different time aggregation periods. The time periods where changes in dimension occur can be related to average rainfall event durations and average dry period lengths. Also, the dimension is shown to be a decreasing function of the rainfall intensity level. This suggests a multidimensional fractal behavior (multiscaling), and to test this hypothesis, the probability distribution/multiple scaling method was applied to the time series. The results confirm that the investigated rainfall time series display a multidimensional fractal behavior, at least within a significant part of the studied timescales, which indicates that the rainfall process can be described by a multiplicative cascade process.},

  Abstract                 = {Conventional parametrization schemes in weather and climate prediction models describe the effects of subgrid-scale processes by deterministic bulk formulae which depend on local resolved-scale variables and a number of adjustable parameters. Despite the unquestionable success of such models for weather and climate prediction, it is impossible to justify the use of such formulae from first principles. Using low-order dynamical-systems models, and elementary results from dynamical-systems and turbulence theory, it is shown that even if unresolved scales only describe a small fraction of the total variance of the system, neglecting their variability can, in some circumstances, lead to gross errors in the climatology of the dominant scales. It is suggested that some of the remaining errors in weather and climate prediction models may have their origin in the neglect of subgrid-scale variability, and that such variability should be parametrized by non-local dynamically based stochastic parametrization schemes. Results from existing schemes are described, and mechanisms which might account for the impact of random parametrization error on planetary-scale motions are discussed. Proposals for the development of non-local stochastic-dynamic parametrization schemes are outlined, based on potential-vorticity diagnosis, singular-vector analysis and a simple stochastic cellular automaton model.},

  Abstract                 = {The predictability of weather and climate forecasts is determined by the projection of uncertainties in both initial conditions and model formulation onto flow-dependent instabilities of the chaotic climate attractor. Since it is essential to be able to estimate the impact of such uncertainties on forecast accuracy, no weather or climate prediction can be considered complete without a forecast of the associated flow-dependent predictability. The problem of predicting uncertainty can be posed in terms of the Liouville equation for the growth of initial uncertainty, or a form of Fokker-Planck equation if model uncertainties are also taken into account. However, in practice, the problem is approached using ensembles of integrations of comprehensive weather and climate prediction models, with explicit perturbations to both initial conditions and model formulation; the resulting ensemble of forecasts can be interpreted as a probabilistic prediction. Many of the difficulties in forecasting predictability arise from the large dimensionality of the climate system, and special techniques to generate ensemble perturbations have been developed. Special emphasis is placed on the use of singular-vector methods to determine the linearly-unstable component of the initial probability density function. Methods to sample uncertainties in model formulation are also described. Practical ensemble prediction systems for prediction on timescales of days (weather forecasts), seasons (including predictions of El NiÃ±o) and decades (including climate change projections) are described, and examples of resulting probabilistic forecast products shown. Methods to evaluate the skill of these probabilistic forecasts are outlined. By using ensemble forecasts as input to a simple decision-model analysis, it is shown that probability forecasts of weather and climate have greater potential economic value than corresponding single deterministic forecasts with uncertain accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {An important application of global precipitation measurement rainfall products is providing forcing inputs for hydrologic applications, and the goal of this study is to assess how skillful they are for such applications. To do that, we force a land surface model with both satellite estimates and ground-based measurements and test how well they can predict hydrologic states and fluxes useful for water resource applications, i.e., soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and river streamflow. A number of satellite-based precipitation products ranging from retrievals based only on microwave measurements, combined microwave + infrared estimates, to gauge-corrected products are tested over the entire continental United States region. As a reference to the satellite retrievals, estimates from global and regional weather model reanalyses (the analysis fields from these models) are tested as well. It is found that the microwave + infrared combined estimates can match the skill of the coarse resolution European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global reanalysis but not the regional National Center for Environmental Predictions reanalysis. Gauge corrections to satellite products significantly enhance their skill by greatly reducing the bias in hydrologic predictions, especially over mountainous areas. Rainfall errors are shown to have strong impact on river streamflow predictions and column total soil moisture and relatively weak impact on near surface moisture and evapotranspiration. River streamflow experiments also suggest that satellite rainfall errors are highly correlated in space within the range of one storm system and thus do not reduce in magnitude with spatial scale (basin size).},

  Abstract                 = {In coastal regions sheltered from the direct impact of swell- and storm-wave activity, locally generated wind waves, particularly those associated with strong sea-breeze activity, play a dominant role in controlling nearshore and foreshore processes. Field data collected from the Perth Metropolitan Coast (western Australia) during a typical summer sea-breeze cycle, are presented. It is demonstrated that the nearshore environment responds rapidly to an increase in wind speed (up to 12 m s‚àí1) during the sea breeze, resulting in considerable changes to the nearshore hydrodynamics and morphology. Incident wave energy increased during the sea breeze and was associated with development of a wind-wave field with significant wave heights up to 0.9 m. Nearshore currents responded to this change in wave climate with the development of net offshore near-bed currents and a rapid increase in the mean longshore current from &lt; 0.05 m s‚àí1 to 1.0 m s‚àí1 A 10-fold increase in suspended sediment concentration and a 100-fold increase in the longshore sand transport resulted from the effects of the sea-breeze system. Erosion of the beachface was coincident with the development of the wind-wave field. Sea breeze wave-driven water circulation also completely eroded beach cusps (wavelength 20‚Äì30 m), overwhelmed the rip current system associated with the beach cusps and suppressed the infra-gravity wave frequencies in the incident wave and swash record. The beach cusps reformed after the cessation of the sea breeze. It is demonstrated that the beachface is in a constant stage of adjustment to the incident wave energy through the diurnal sea-breeze cycle alternating between dissipative and reflective morphodynamic regimes. The results may be used to determine the impact of a medium-sized storm on the beachface. It is clear that the sea-breeze system plays a major role in controlling the nearshore and foreshore processes not only in this region, but also on other geographic locations where strong sea breezes are present.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the results of simulations carried out with the Met Office Unified Model at 12, 4 and 1.5 km resolution for a large region centred on West Africa using several different representations of the convection processes. These span a range of resolutions from much coarser than the size of the convection processes to cloud-system-resolving and thus encompass the intermediate "grey zone". The diurnal cycle in the extent of convective regions in the models is tested against observations from the Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget instrument on Meteosat-8. By this measure, the two best-performing simulations are a 12 km model without convective parametrization, using Smagorinsky-style subgrid-scale mixing in all three dimensions, and a 1.5 km simulation with two-dimensional Smagorinsky mixing. Of these, the 12 km model produces a better match to the magnitude of the total cloud fraction but the 1.5 km one results in better timing for its peak value. The results suggest that the previously reported improvement in the representation of the diurnal cycle of convective organization in the 4 km model compared with the standard 12 km configuration is principally a result of the convection scheme employed rather than the improved resolution per se. The details of this result and implications for high-resolution model simulations are discussed. Copyright Â© 2013 Royal Meteorological Society},

Furthermore, the underlying framework of the SMCM is able to reproduce the observed functional dependencies of convective variability on the imposed large-scale state?an encouraging result on the road toward a novel convection parameterization approach. However, establishing sound cause-and-effect relationships between tropical convection and the large-scale environment remains problematic and warrants further research.},

  Abstract                 = {By following an analogy to earthquakes, we demonstrate how, from the point of
view of energy ﬂow through an open system, rain is analogous to many other relaxational processes in Nature. Deﬁning rain events as the basic entities of the phenomenon, we show that
the number density of rain events per year is inversely proportional to the released water column raised to the power 1.4. This is the rain-equivalent of the Gutenberg–Richter law for
earthquakes. The event durations and the waiting times between events are also characterized
by scaling regions, where no typical time scale exists. The Hurst exponent of the rain intensity
signal H = 0.76 > 0.5. It is valid in the temporal range from minutes up to the full duration of the
signal of half a year. All of our ﬁndings are consistent with the concept of self-organized criticality, which refers to the tendency of slowly driven non-equilibrium systems to evolve into a
state of scale free behaviour. We note that self-organized criticality may offer an alternative to
the chaos theoretic perspective on the subject of rain.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract Although the distribution of sunshine is symmetrical about the equator, the earth's climate is not. Climatic asymmetries are prominent in the eastern tropical Pacific and Atlantic Oceans where the regions of maximum sea surface temperature, convective cloud cover, and rainfall are north of the equator. This is the result of two sets of factors: interactions between the ocean and atmosphere that are capable of converting symmetry into asymmetry, and the geometries of the continents that determine in which longitudes the interactions are effective and in which hemisphere the warmest waters and the intertropical convergence zone are located. 'The Ocean-atmosphere interactions are most effective where the thermocline is shallow because the winds can readily affect sea surface temperatures in such regions. The thermocline happens to shoal in the eastern equatorial Pacific and Atlantic, but not in the eastern Indian Ocean, because easterly trade winds prevail over the tropical Atlantic and Pacific whereas monsoons, with a far larger meridional component are dominant over the Indian Ocean. That is how the global distribution of the continents, by determining the large-scale wind patterns, causes climatic asymmetries to be prominent in some bands of longitude but not others. The explanation for asymmetries that favor the Northern rather than Southern Hemisphere with the warmest waters and the ITCZ- involves the details of the local coastal geometries: the bulge of western Africa to the north of the Gulf of Guinea and the slope of the western coast of the Americas relative to meridians. low-level stratus clouds over cold waters are crucial to the maintenance of the asymmetries. },

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary This chapter provides an overview of examples of mesoscale simulations of particular mesoscale phenomena. Mesoscale atmospheric systems are divided into two groupsâânamely, those forced primarily by surface inhomogeneities (terrain- and physiographic-induced mesoscale systems) and by instabilities in traveling larger-scale disturbances (synoptically induced mesoscale systems). The mesoscale systems are considered to be an initial and lateral boundary value problem. The sea and land breezes over flat terrain are a result of the geographically fixed nature of the phenomenon, as well as the repetitive nature of the event. Fires can also generate mesoscale atmospheric circulations. Variations of snow cover also generate mesoscale flows. The wind-driven sublimation of snow is known to properly predict moisture fluxes. The influence of terrain and the horizontal pressure gradient force orientation on the diurnal variation of the wind in complex terrain is discussed in the chapter. Urban circulations are similar to sea and land breezes and mountain-valley winds. The interactions between the mesoscale and synoptic scales of mesoscale systems are complex. The convective bands embedded in stratiform cloud systems, squall lines, mesoscale convective clusters, frontal circulations, and tropical cyclones comprise synoptically induced mesoscale systems. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A stochastic parameterization scheme for deep convection is described, suitable for use in both climate and NWP models. Theoretical arguments and the results of cloud-resolving models are discussed in order to motivate the form of the scheme. In the deterministic limit, it tends to a spectrum of entraining/detraining plumes and is similar to other current parameterizations. The stochastic variability describes the local fluctuations about a large-scale equilibrium state. Plumes are drawn at random from a probability distribution function (PDF) that defines the chance of finding a plume of given cloud-base mass flux within each model grid box. The normalization of the PDF is given by the ensemble-mean mass flux, and this is computed with a CAPE closure method. The characteristics of each plume produced are determined using an adaptation of the plume model from the Kain–Fritsch parameterization. Initial tests in the single-column version of the Unified Model verify that the scheme is effective in producing the desired distributions of convective variability without adversely affecting the mean state.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently a number of authors have considered general procedures for coupling stochastic systems. If the individual components of a system, when considered in isolation, are found to possess the simplifying feature of either reversibility, quasireversibility or partial balance they can be coupled in such a way that the equilibrium analysis of the system is considerably simpler than one might expect in advance. In particular the system usually exhibits a product-form equilibrium distribution and this is often insensitive to the precise specification of the individual components. It is true, however, that certain kinds of components lose their simplifying feature if the specification of the coupling procedure changes. From a practical point of view it is important, therefore, to determine, if, and then under what conditions, the revelant feature is preserved. In this paper we obtain conditions under which partial balance in a component is preserved and these often amount to the requirement that there exists a quantity which is unaffected by the internal workings of the component in question. We give particular attention to the components of a stratified clustering process as these most often suffer from loss of partial balance.},

Five objectively derived regimes of the wet season are obtained and are found to differ significantly in their synoptic environment, cloud patterns, and rainfall distributions. One regime is primarily associated with the trade wind regime. Two regimes are associated with the lead up to and break periods of the monsoon at Darwin. A fourth regime is clearly identified with the active monsoon at Darwin and is offered as a definition of monsoon onset. This regime captures the active monsoon environment associated with significant widespread rainfall. The fifth regime is a mixed regime, with some days associated with the inactive monsoon, a period of westerly zonal winds at Darwin associated with relatively suppressed convection compared with the active monsoon. Other days for this regime are break period conditions with a low-level westerly flow below 900 hPa. },

  Abstract                 = {High-resolution observations and regional climate model simulations reveal that precipitation over the Maritime Continent is mostly concentrated over islands. Analysis of the diurnal cycles of precipitation and winds indicates that this is predominantly caused by sea-breeze convergence over islands, reinforced by mountain–valley winds and further amplified by the cumulus merger processes. Comparison of a regional climate model control simulation to a flat-island run and an all-ocean run demonstrates that the underrepresentation of islands and terrain in the Maritime Continent weakens the atmospheric disturbance associated with the diurnal cycle, and hence underestimates precipitation. The implication of these regional modeling results is that systematic errors in coarse-resolution global circulation models probably result from insufficient representation of land–sea breezes associated with the complex topography in the Maritime Continent. It is found that precipitation in the Maritime Continent, simulated by a global model, is indeed smaller than observed. The simulated upper-atmospheric velocity potential, which represents large-scale tropospheric heating, was substantially displaced eastward compared to observations. Possible approaches toward solving this problem are suggested.},

Over the maritime continent in January 1963, heat generated from excessive rains was efficiently transported northward and through conversion of potential to kinetic energy proably helped maintain an intense subtropical jet stream. In January 1964 drought over the maritime continent was accompained by a relative accumulation of heat in the upper troposphere, associated with inefficient poleward transport, and a much weaker circulation. Most winters over the western Pacific and southeast Asia fluctuate between situations typical of January 1963 and January 1964. Since the troposphere over the maritime continent in winter is probably the single greatest source of energy for the extratropical circulation, the proposed Marshall Island experiment should be modified to include Indonesia and be rescheduled to include winter.

  Abstract                 = { Abstract A key factor limiting the reliability of simulations of anthropogenic climate change is the inability to accurately represent the various effects of clouds on climate. Despite the best efforts of the community, the problem has resisted solution for several decades. The reasons for this are briefly reviewed and it is argued that it will be many more decades before the problem can be solved through the approaches to cloud parameterization that have been used up to now. An alternative approach, called superparameterization, is then outlined, in which high-resolution cloud system–resolving models (CSRMs) are used in place of the conventional cloud parameterizations. Tests performed with the Community Atmosphere Model show that superparameterizations can give more realistic simulations of the current climate, including greatly improved simulations of the Madden–Julian oscillation and other tropical wave disturbances. Superparameterizations increase the cost of climate simulation by a factor of several hundred dollars, but can make efficient use of massively parallel computers. In addition, superparameterizations make it possible for a climate model to converge to a global CSRM as the horizontal grid spacing of the climate model decreases to a few kilometers. No existing global atmospheric model has this convergence property. Superparameterizations have the potential to greatly increase the reliability of climate change simulations. },

From the point of view of central pressure, this anticyclone is much more intense than the permanent anticyclones in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. During the last 116 years there have been periods during which the anticyclone appeared stronger and periods when it appeared weaker. Since 1970 a continuous decrease in central pressure of the anticyclone is observed, and is related to a continuous temperature rise of the 1000–500 hPa layer for the same time interval. Their correlation is found to be negative. After 1950, maximum values of central pressure are observed corresponding to maximum values of solar activity. In some of the time series of the anticyclone central pressure, periodicities of 58, 4.5, 3.5, and 3 years are observed, as well as the Quasi-biennial Oscillation.},

  Abstract                 = {AbstractGiven the reality of anthropogenic global warming, it is tempting to seek an anthropogenic component in any recent change in the statistics of extreme weather. This paper cautions that such efforts may, however, lead to wrong conclusions if the distinctively skewed and heavy-tailed aspects of the probability distributions of daily weather anomalies are ignored or misrepresented. Departures of several standard deviations from the mean, although rare, are far more common in such a distinctively non-Gaussian world than they are in a Gaussian world. This further complicates the problem of detecting changes in tail probabilities from historical records of limited length and accuracy.A possible solution is to exploit the fact that the salient non-Gaussian features of the observed distributions are captured by so-called stochastically generated skewed (SGS) distributions that include Gaussian distributions as special cases. SGS distributions are associated with damped linear Markov processes perturbed by asymmetric stochastic noise and as such represent the simplest physically based prototypes of the observed distributions. The tails of SGS distributions can also be directly linked to generalized extreme value (GEV) and generalized Pareto (GP) distributions. The Markov process model can be used to provide rigorous confidence intervals and to investigate temporal persistence statistics. The procedure is illustrated for assessing changes in the observed distributions of daily wintertime indices of large-scale atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic and North Pacific sectors over the period 1872–2011. No significant changes in these indices are found from the first to the second half of the period.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract Data collected during the Maritime Continent Thunderstorm Experiment (MCTEX) (10 November–10 December 1995) have been used to analyze boundary layer development and circulations over two almost flat, tropical islands. The two adjacent islands have a combined length of about 170 km from east to west and 70 km from north to south. Intense thunderstorms formed over these islands every day of the field campaign. The boundary layer depth, temperature, and circulation over the island have been measured over the full diurnal cycle using a multiple radar analysis combined with surface and radiosonde measurements. On average, the island boundary layer depth reaches 1.5 km by early to midafternoon coinciding with the development of the deep convection. Thus, the island boundary layer is significantly deeper than the typical tropical oceanic boundary layer. In the midafternoon, thunderstorm outflows and their associated cold pool stabilize the lower boundary layer, suppressing late convection. This is followed by a period of partial boundary layer recovery for 1–2 h. After sunset, cooling leads to a deepening ground-based inversion below a residual mixed layer. Near the island center, the residual mixed layer of island-modified air is replaced by air of oceanic origin by about 2300 LST (local standard time) that then persists until sunrise the next day. The advection of boundary layer air of oceanic origin over the islands every evening resets the boundary layer development cycle. It is shown that much of the variation in the diurnal temperature profile is a result of thunderstorm activity, radiative processes, and the advection of island and oceanic boundary layer air. },

  Abstract                 = { AbstractThe relationships between the onset of tropical deep convection, column water vapor (CWV), and other measures of conditional instability are analyzed with 2 yr of data from the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facility in Manacapuru, Brazil, as part of the Green Ocean Amazon (GOAmazon) campaign, and with 3.5 yr of CWV derived from global positioning system meteorology at a nearby site in Manaus, Brazil. Important features seen previously in observations over tropical oceans—precipitation conditionally averaged by CWV exhibiting a sharp pickup at high CWV, and the overall shape of the CWV distribution for both precipitating and nonprecipitating points—are also found for this tropical continental region. The relationship between rainfall and CWV reflects the impact of lower-free-tropospheric moisture variability on convection. Specifically, CWV over land, as over ocean, is a proxy for the effect of free-tropospheric moisture on conditional instability as indicated by entraining plume calculations from GOAmazon data. Given sufficient mixing in the lower troposphere, higher CWV generally results in greater plume buoyancies through a deep convective layer. Although sensitivity of buoyancy to other controls in the Amazon is suggested, such as boundary layer and microphysical processes, the CWV dependence is consistent with the observed precipitation onset. Overall, leading aspects of the relationship between CWV and the transition to deep convection in the Amazon have close parallels over tropical oceans. The relationship is robust to averaging on time and space scales appropriate for convective physics but is strongly smoothed for averages greater than 3 h or 2.5°. },

  Abstract                 = {Recognition of naturally occurring objects is a c hallenging task. In particular, the recognition of clouds is particularly challenging as the texture of such objects is extremely variable under diﬀerent atmospheric conditions. There are several beneﬁts of a practical system that can detect and recognise clouds in natural images especially for applications such as air traﬃc control. In this paper, we test well-known texture feature extraction
approaches for automatically training a classiﬁer system to recognise cumulus, towering cumulus, cumulo-nimbus clouds, sky and other clouds. For cloud recognition, we use a total of ﬁve diﬀerent feature extraction methods, namely autocorrelation, co-occurrence matrices, edge frequency, Law’s features and primitive length. We use the k-nearest neighbour and neural network classi ﬁers for identifying cloud types in test images. This exhaustive testing gives us a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of diﬀerent feature extraction methods and classiﬁcation techniques on the given problem. In particular, we ﬁnd that no single feature extraction method is best suited for recognising all classes. Each method has its own merits. We discuss these merits individually and suggest further
improvements in this diﬃcult area.},

  Abstract                 = {The ``maritime continent'' area to the north of Australia is one of three major global centres of tropical convective activity and has a fundamental role in the general circulation of the atmosphere. Tropical convection within this region is dominated by island thunderstorm activity which is strongly diurnally modulated, is deep and is geographically fixed. The storms over Bathurst and Melville Islands (11.5{\textdegree}S, 131{\textdegree}E) are representative of island thunderstorms that occur throughout the maritime continent and are believed to be primarily a response to sea breeze convergence. In this paper, we produce an indicative climatology of the Melville and Bathurst Island sea breeze (obtained during a three week period of the 1988 transition season), and we examine the surface patterns of island-scale convergence and divergence, especially in relation to the diurnal modulation of island thunderstorm activity. These observations are placed in the context of the broadscale environment and the relevant surface energy balance and radiation regimes.},

  Abstract                 = {The representation of the diurnal cycle in the Hadley Centre climate model is evaluated using simulations of the infrared radiances observed by Meteosat 7. In both the window and water vapour channels, the standard version of the model with 19 levels produces a good simulation of the geographical distributions of the mean radiances and of the amplitude of the diurnal cycle. Increasing the vertical resolution to 30 levels leads to further improvements in the mean fields. The timing of the maximum and minimum radiances reveals significant model errors, however, which are sensitive to the frequency with which the radiation scheme is called. In most regions, these errors are consistent with well documented errors in the timing of convective precipitation, which peaks before noon in the model, in contrast to the observed peak in the late afternoon or evening. When the radiation scheme is called every model time step (half an hour), as opposed to every three hours in the standard version, the timing of the minimum radiance is improved for convective regions over central Africa, due to the creation of upper-level layer-cloud by detrainment from the convection scheme, which persists well after the convection itself has dissipated. However, this produces a decoupling between the timing of the diurnal cycles of precipitation and window channel radiance. The possibility is raised that a similar decoupling may occur in reality and the implications of this for the retrieval of the diurnal cycle of precipitation from infrared radiances are discussed.

  Abstract                 = {Recent improvements in mapping of global population distribution makes it possible to estimate the number and distribution of people near coasts with greater accuracy than previously possible, and hence consider the potential exposure of these populations to coastal hazards. In this paper, we combine the updated Gridded Population of the World (GPW2) population distribution estimate for 1990 and lighted settlement imagery with a global digital elevation model (DEM) and a high resolution vector coastline. This produces bivariate distributions of population, lighted settlements and land area as functions of elevation and coastal proximity. The near-coastal population within 100 km of a shoreline and 100 m of sea level was estimated as $1.2 \times 10^9$ people with average densities nearly 3 times higher than the global average density. Within the near coastal-zone, the average population density diminishes more rapidly with elevation than with distance, while the opposite is true of lighted settlements. Lighted settlements are concentrated within 5 km of coastlines worldwide, whereas average population densities are higher at elevations below 20 m throughout the 100 km width of the near-coastal zone. Presently most of the near-coastal population live in relatively densely-populated rural areas and small to medium cities, rather than in large cities. A range of improvements are required to define a better baseline and scenarios for policy analysis. Improving the resolution of the underlying population data is a priority.},

  Abstract                 = {Cloud-to-ground lightning data from the National Lightning Detection Network are used to create a warm season (May–September) lightning climatology for the northern Gulf of Mexico coast for the 14-yr period 1989–2002. Each day is placed into one of five flow regimes based on the orientation of the low-level flow with respect to the coastline. This determination is made using the vector mean 1000–700-hPa wind data at Lake Charles and Slidell, Louisiana. Flash densities are calculated for daily, hourly, and nocturnal periods.

Spatial patterns of composite 24-h and nocturnal flash density indicate that lightning decreases in an east-to-west direction over the region. Flash densities for the 24-h period are greatest over land near the coast, with relative maxima located near Houston, Texas; Lake Charles, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans, Louisiana; Biloxi, Mississippi; and Mobile, Alabama. Flash densities during the nocturnal period are greatest over the coastal waters.

Lightning across the northern Gulf coast is closely related to the prevailing low-level synoptic flow, which controls the sea breeze, the dominant forcing mechanism during the warm season. Southwest flow, the most unstable and humid of the five regimes, exhibits the most flashes. In this case, sea-breeze-induced convection is located slightly inland from the coast. Northeast flow, the driest and most stable of the regimes, exhibits the least amount of lightning. The large-scale flow restricts the sea breeze to near the coastline.

Geographic features and local mesoscale circulations are found to affect lightning across the region. Geographic features include lakes, bays, marshes, swamps, and coastline orientations. Thermal circulations associated with these features interact with the main sea breeze to produce complex lightning patterns over the area.},

It is suggested that the criticisms have sidestepped the concept of cooperative intensification as envisaged by Ooyama. However, a later, but much neglected, contention by Ooyama is supported: this is that the linear theories worked out by Charney and Eliassen and others are, in themselves, physically illfounded. the relationship between Ooyama's cooperative intensification theory and the recent theory of Emanuel based on Wind-Induced Surface Heat Exchange (WISHE) is also discussed. the main difference between these two theories appears to be the degree of emphasis placed by the respective authors on the relative importance of convection and surface fluxes in the intensification of hurricanes.},

  Abstract                 = {AbstractThe present study shows that winter cold events over eastern China can be induced by Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO)-associated anomalous convection over the Maritime Continent. We conduct composite analysis separately for identified intraseasonal cold events over eastern China that occur following anomalous convection over the Maritime Continent and the tropical Indian Ocean. For cold events related to anomalous convection over the Maritime Continent, the southward intrusion of cold air into eastern China takes an eastward path in association with an eastward location of an anomalous Siberian high compared to cold events related to anomalous convection over the tropical Indian Ocean. The Maritime Continent convection-related cold events tend to occur with a negative Arctic Oscillation (AO), whereas the relationship between the tropical Indian Ocean convection-related cold events and the AO is weak. Anomalous convective heating over the Maritime Continent triggers a poleward Rossby wave train, which, together with an AO-related southward wave train from northern Eurasia, contributes to the deepening of the East Asian trough. The poleward wave energy dispersion is similarly triggered by anomalous convective heating over the tropical Indian Ocean. In both types of cold events, anomalous tropical heating induces a meridional vertical circulation, with large-scale airmass convergence in the upper midtroposphere and descending of air on the northern branch of the vertical cell over Siberia. The upper-level mass convergence and the radiative cooling over Siberia work together for the enhancement and southeastward expansion of the Siberian high and the southward intrusion of cold anomalies to eastern China.},

The character of liquid precipitation (defined as a combination of accumulation, frequency, and intensity) over the global oceans is significantly different from the character of liquid precipitation produced by global weather and climate models. Five different models are used in this comparison representing state-of-the-art weather prediction models, state-of-the-art climate models, and the emerging high-resolution global cloud “resolving” models. The differences between observed and modeled precipitation are larger than can be explained by observational retrieval errors or by the inherent sampling differences between observations and models. We show that the time integrated accumulations of precipitation produced by models closely match observations when globally composited. However, these models produce precipitation approximately twice as often as that observed and make rainfall far too lightly. This finding reinforces similar findings from other studies based on surface accumulated rainfall measurements. The implications of this dreary state of model depiction of the real world are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = { AbstractRealistic simulation of different modes of atmospheric variability ranging from diurnal cycle to interannual variation in global climate models (GCMs) depends crucially on the convection trigger criteria. In this study, using the data from constrained variational analysis by the Atmospheric System Research program for single-column models (SCM), the performance of the commonly used convective trigger functions in GCMs is evaluated based on the equitable threat score (ETS) value, a widely used forecast verification metric. From the ETS score, three consistently better-performing trigger functions were identified. They are based on the dilute and undilute convective available potential energy (CAPE) generation rate from large-scale forcing in the free troposphere (hereafter dCAPE) and parcel buoyancy at the lifting condensation level (Bechtold scheme). The key variables used to define these trigger functions are examined in detail. It is found that the dilute dCAPE trigger function performs the best consistently in both the tropical and midlatitude convective environment. Analysis of the composite fields of key variables of the trigger functions, based on the correct prediction, overprediction and underprediction of convection, and correct prediction of no-convection cases for convective onset, brings to light some critical factors responsible for the performance of the trigger functions. The lower-tropospheric advective forcing in dilute dCAPE trigger and vertical velocity in Bechtold trigger are identified to be the most importance ones. Suggestions are offered for further improvements. },

  Abstract                 = {AbstractDual-polarization radar rainfall estimation relationships have been extensively tested in continental and subtropical coastal rain regimes, with little testing over tropical oceans where the majority of rain on Earth occurs. A 1.5-yr Indo-Pacific warm pool disdrometer dataset was used to quantify the impacts of tropical oceanic drop-size distribution (DSD) variability on dual-polarization radar variables and their resulting utility for rainfall estimation. Variables that were analyzed include differential reflectivity Zdr; specific differential phase Kdp; reflectivity Zh; and specific attenuation Ah. When compared with continental or coastal convection, tropical oceanic Zdr and Kdp values were more often of low magnitude (<0.5 dB, <0.3° km?1) and Zdr was lower for a given Kdp or Zh, consistent with observations of tropical oceanic DSDs being dominated by numerous, small, less-oblate drops. New X-, C-, and S-band R estimators were derived: R(Kdp), R(Ah), R(Kdp, ?dr), R(z, ?dr), and R(Ah, ?dr), which use linear versions of Zdr and Zh, namely ?dr and z. Except for R(Kdp), convective/stratiform partitioning was unnecessary for these estimators. All dual-polarization estimators outperformed updated R(z) estimators derived from the same dataset. The best-performing estimator was R(Kdp, ?dr), followed by R(Ah, ?dr) and R(z, ?dr). The R error was further reduced in an updated blended algorithm choosing between R(z), R(z, ?dr), R(Kdp), and R(Kdp, ?dr) depending on Zdr > 0.25 dB and Kdp > 0.3° km?1 thresholds. Because of these thresholds and the lack of hail, R(Kdp) was never used. At all wavelengths, R(z) was still needed 43% of the time during light rain (R < 5 mm h?1, Zdr < 0.25 dB), composing 7% of the total rain volume. As wavelength decreased, R(Kdp, ?dr) was used more often, R(z, ?dr) was used less often, and the blended algorithm became increasingly more accurate than R(z).

  Abstract                 = { Abstract A prognostic scheme for stratiform and convective clouds is developed for large-scale models. The time evolution of clouds is defined through the large-scale budget equations for cloud water content and cloud air (which is converted into a prognostic equation for fractional cloud cover). The scheme considers the formation of clouds in connection with large-scale ascent diabatic cooling, boundary-layer turbulence, and horizontal transport of cloud water from convective updrafts. Clouds dissipate through adiabatic and diabatic heating, turbulent mixing of cloud air with unsaturated environmental air, and depletion of cloud water by precipitation. The scheme differs from conventional schemes in its approach, which is fully prognostic and model consistent, and in the larger degree of complexity as the formation of anvil and circus clouds originating by cumulus updrafts and boundary-layer clouds is included. The scheme has been tested in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) global forecast model and compared with the ECMWF operational cloud scheme. The results show that realistic cloud fields are produced when compared to observed values of cloud cover and cloud water content. The representation of cloud process in connection with anvil clouds is shown to have a strong effect on the hydrological cycle and the maintenance of the tropospheric water vapor content. },

  abstract  = {Abstract An investigation is conducted to document the role convectively generated cold pools play in determining the spatial organization of tropical deep convection. Using a high-resolution cloud-resolving model, the evolution of cold pools produced by deep convection is examined, in the situation of limited large-scale wind shear, and a homogeneous underlying sea surface temperature.

Abstract An investigation is conducted to document the role convectively generated cold pools play in determining the spatial organization of tropical deep convection. Using a high-resolution cloud-resolving model, the evolution of cold pools produced by deep convection is examined, in the situation of limited large-scale wind shear, and a homogeneous underlying sea surface temperature. Ignoring the cold pools resulting from multiple deep convective events, the mean model cold pool attained a minimum temperature and water vapor mixing ratio depression of 1 K and 1.5 g kg?1, respectively; a horizontal velocity increase of 4.8 m s?1; and the latent and sensible heat fluxes are increased by a factor of 1.9 and 2.6, respectively.

In 1997, Kiehl and Trenberth provided a review of past estimates and performed a number of radiative computations to better establish the role of clouds and various greenhouse gases in the overall radiative energy flows, with top-of-atmosphere (TOA) values constrained by Earth Radiation Budget Experiment values from 1985 to 1989, when the TOA values were approximately in balance. The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) measurements from March 2000 to May 2004 are used at TOA but adjusted to an estimated imbalance from the enhanced greenhouse effect of 0.9 W m?2. Revised estimates of surface turbulent fluxes are made based on various sources. The partitioning of solar radiation in the atmosphere is based in part on the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) FD computations that utilize the global ISCCP cloud data every 3 h, and also accounts for increased atmospheric absorption by water vapor and aerosols. Surface upward longwave radiation is adjusted to account for spatial and temporal variability. A lack of closure in the energy balance at the surface is accommodated by making modest changes to surface fluxes, with the downward longwave radiation as the main residual to ensure a balance. Values are also presented for the land and ocean domains that include a net transport of energy from ocean to land of 2.2 petawatts (PW) of which 3.2 PW is from moisture (latent energy) transport, while net dry static energy transport is from land to ocean.

  Abstract                 = {The dynamics of the pressure distribution associated with the sea-breeze circulation is investigated. Analysis of hourly observations of surface pressure reveals that, on a typical sea-breeze day, large surface-pressure falls are recorded very far inland. Using a linear numerical model we show that this can only be understood when sound waves are taken into account. Sound waves are excited when air in the boundary layer over land expands due to diabatic heating. the numerical study reveals that vertically travelling sound waves induce a pressure increase through the entire atmosphere above the heated layer within a few minutes, while horizontally travelling sound waves induce a surface-pressure decrease over land and a surface-pressure increase over sea, with the resulting horizontal surface-pressure gradient initiating the sea breeze. Because the signal travels inland at the speed of sound (about 300 m s-1), points at a distance of more than 1000 km from the coast experience a surface-pressure decrease within an hour after the initiation of diabatic heating over land. the pressure decrease near the earth's surface over land, as well as the pressure increase aloft, is in accord with the observations at mountain stations and the analyses of the observed daytime surface-pressure changes in summer over the continent and adjacent seas. the implications of these findings for hydrostatic modelling of sea breezes are investigated. It appears that after one hour the hydrostatic sea breeze is 10% stronger than the non-hydrostatic sea breeze, while the hydrostatic return current is about 20% weaker.},

  Abstract                 = {The Tropical Warm Pool–International Cloud Experiment (TWP-ICE) provided extensive observational data sets designed to initialize, force, and constrain atmospheric model simulations. In this first of a two-part study, precipitation and cloud structures within nine cloud-resolving model simulations are compared with scanning radar reflectivity and satellite infrared brightness temperature observations during an active monsoon period from 19 to 25 January 2006. Seven of nine simulations overestimate convective area by 20\% or more leading to general overestimation of convective rainfall. This is balanced by underestimation of stratiform rainfall by 5\% to 50\% despite overestimation of stratiform area by up to 65\% because of a preponderance of very low stratiform rain rates in all simulations. All simulations fail to reproduce observed radar reflectivity distributions above the melting level in convective regions and throughout the troposphere in stratiform regions. Observed precipitation-sized ice reaches higher altitudes than simulated precipitation-sized ice despite some simulations that predict lower than observed top-of-atmosphere infrared brightness temperatures. For the simulations that overestimate radar reflectivity aloft, graupel is the cause with one-moment microphysics schemes whereas snow is the cause with two-moment microphysics schemes. Differences in simulated radar reflectivity are more highly correlated with differences in mass mean melted diameter (Dm) than differences in ice water content. Dm is largely dependent on the mass-dimension relationship and gamma size distribution parameters such as size intercept (N0) and shape parameter (μ). Having variable density, variable N0, or μ greater than zero produces radar reflectivities closest to those observed.},

  Abstract                 = {Meteorological measurements were carried out at North Chennai semi rural area during pre-monsoon period as a part of an air quality study program. Analysis of the data showed the effects of coastal terrain namely the land-sea breeze circulation, temperature cooling during the sea breeze, difference in onset times at these sites etc. Sea breeze onset was observed with a sharp turning of the wind from westerly to south easterly associated with rise in wind speed. Advection speed of the front was about 2.0¬†m s‚àí&#xa0;1. A simple mesoscale meteorological model (MAM-I) developed at Kalpakkam for coastal atmospheric dispersion estimation was used to simulate the observed characteristics. All the major features observed could be simulated by the model while significant difference was noticed in sea breeze frontal movement. \{MAM\} results were also inter-compared with MM5. There were no significant differences in the estimate of mean parameters by both the models. It is concluded that the simple model, which takes less run time in a desktop PC, is adequate enough for practical application of providing wind field for plume dispersion models at coastal sites. },

The model comprises equations for velocity, potential temperature, and moist entropy in the boundary layer as well as equations for the free tropospheric barotropic (vertically uniform) velocity and first two baroclinic modes of vertical structure. It is based on the multicloud model of Khouider and Majda coupled to the bulk boundary layer?shallow cumulus model of Stevens. The original multicloud model has a purely thermodynamic boundary layer and no barotropic velocity mode. Here, boundary layer horizontal velocity divergence is matched with barotropic convergence in the free troposphere and yields environmental downdrafts. Both environmental and convective downdrafts act to transport dry midtropospheric air into the boundary layer. Basic states in radiative?convective equilibrium are found and are shown to be consistent with observations of boundary layer and free troposphere climatology. The linear stability of these basic states, in the case without rotation, is then analyzed for a variety of tropospheric regimes. The inclusion of boundary layer dynamics?specifically, environmental downdrafts and entrainment of free tropospheric air?enhances the instability of both the synoptic-scale moist gravity waves and nonpropagating congestus modes in the multicloud model. The congestus mode has a preferred synoptic-scale wavelength, which is absent when a purely thermodynamic boundary layer is employed. The weak destabilization of a fast mesoscale wave, with a phase speed of 26 m s?1 and coupling to deep convection, is also discussed.

It is based on the multicloud model of Khouider and Majda coupled to the bulk boundary layer?shallow cumulus model of Stevens. The original multicloud model has a purely thermodynamic boundary layer and no barotropic velocity mode. Here, boundary layer horizontal velocity divergence is matched with barotropic convergence in the free troposphere and yields environmental downdrafts. Both environmental and convective downdrafts act to transport dry midtropospheric air into the boundary layer. Basic states in radiative?convective equilibrium are found and are shown to be consistent with observations of boundary layer and free troposphere climatology. The linear stability of these basic states, in the case without rotation, is then analyzed for a variety of tropospheric regimes. The inclusion of boundary layer dynamics?specifically, environmental downdrafts and entrainment of free tropospheric air?enhances the instability of both the synoptic-scale moist gravity waves and nonpropagating congestus modes in the multicloud model. The congestus mode has a preferred synoptic-scale wavelength, which is absent when a purely thermodynamic boundary layer is employed. The weak destabilization of a fast mesoscale wave, with a phase speed of 26 m s?1 and coupling to deep convection, is also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract This paper presents fundamental climatological characteristics of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in a simple concise manner using the highly reflective cloud (HRC) dataset. This satellite-derived dataset uses both visible and infrared observations to measure the frequency of occurrence of large-scale convective systems over the global tropics at a 1Â° spatial resolution. These dataset characteristics make the HRC particularly well suited for climatological analysis of the ITCZ because the dataset is based on estimates of organized deep convective cloud systems rather than observations of clouds as a whole, and it provides the spatial resolution needed to identify thew large-wale convective structures. Furthermore, the dataset covers a time period extending nearly two decades, which provides for a fairly robust climatology and the opportunity to examine seasonal and interannual variability of both the convection and the latitude of the ITCZ. },

  Abstract                 = {Impacts of the Madden¿Julian oscillation (MJO) on Australian rainfall and circulation are examined during all four seasons. The authors examine circulation anomalies and a number of different rainfall metrics, each composited contemporaneously for eight MJO phases derived from the real-time multivariate MJO index. Multiple rainfall metrics are examined to allow for greater relevance of the information for applications. The greatest rainfall impact of the MJO occurs in northern Australia in (austral) summer, although in every season rainfall impacts of various magnitude are found in most locations, associated with corresponding circulation anomalies. In northern Australia in all seasons except winter, the rainfall impact is explained by the direct influence of the MJO's tropical convective anomalies, while in winter a weaker and more localized signal in northern Australia appears to result from the modulation of the trade winds as they impinge upon the eastern coasts, especially in the northeast. In extratropical Australia, on the other hand, the occurrence of enhanced (suppressed) rainfall appears to result from induced upward (downward) motion within remotely forced extratropical lows (highs), and from anomalous low-level northerly (southerly) winds that transport moisture from the tropics. Induction of extratropical rainfall anomalies by remotely forced lows and highs appears to operate mostly in winter, whereas anomalous meridional moisture transport appears to operate mainly in the summer, autumn, and to some extent in the spring},

The technique is able to account for periods of growth, mergers, splits and decay, which take place during the lifetime of an individual cluster. It is used to derive statistics on cloud clusters observed during the Winter Monsoon Experiment, which was conducted in the region of the âmaritime continent,â near Borneo, in December, 1978. The size distribution of the clusters identified and tracked shows that by far most of the cumulative cloud cover was accounted for by a few very large clusters. This result implies that the vertical distribution of diabatic heating in the region of the experiment was strongly influenced by dynamical and radiative processes in the widespread stratiform cloud and precipitation areas that typify very large clusters. A pronounced diurnal cycle was characterized by a preference for the very large clusters to reach the middle of their lifetime over the sea during morning. Monsoon âsurgeâ conditions over the South China Sea also strongly favored the occurrence of large clusters over the water north of Borneo. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A prognostic cloud fraction and prognostic condensate scheme has been developed for the Met Office Unified Model. This is designed to replace the scheme currently used in weather forecast and climate simulations, in which cloud fraction and liquid water content are calculated diagnostically. Such a scheme overprescribes links between cloud fraction, condensate and water vapour contents. By contrast, our new prognostic cloud fraction and prognostic condensate scheme (PC2) calculates increments to prognostic variables of liquid, ice and total cloud fractions, water vapour and liquid condensate as a result of each physical process represented in the model. (Ice condensate is already represented prognostically.) This paper provides a summary of the PC2 scheme, describes how it is implemented, and discusses its relationship with other existing cloud schemes. Key aspects of the PC2 formulation are: the consistent derivation of prognostic terms, the reversible nature of the scheme under idealised forcing scenarios, the well-behaved performance in the limit of very low and very high cloud fraction, the inclusion of ice microphysical processes, and the improved representation of cloud erosion processes. A companion paper presents the results from the scheme. ? Crown Copyright 2008. Reproduced with the permission of Her Majesty's Stationery Office. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = { AbstractChanges in tropical convective events provide a test bed for understanding changes of extreme convection in a warming climate. Because convective cloud top in deep convection is associated with cold brightness temperatures (BTs) in infrared window channels, variability in global convective events can be studied by spaceborne measurements of BTs. The sensitivity of BTs, directly measured by an Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) window channel, to natural changes (the seasonal cycle and El Niño–Southern Oscillation) in tropical sea surface temperature (SST) is examined. It is found that tropical average BTs (over the ocean) at the low percentiles of their probability distributions scale with tropical average SSTs (higher SST leading to colder BTs), with the lower percentiles being significantly more sensitive to changes in SST. The sensitivity is reduced for high percentiles of BT and is insignificant for the median BT, and has similar magnitudes for the two natural changes used in the study. The regions where the lower-percentile BTs are most sensitive to SST are near the edges of the convection active areas (intertropical convergence zone and South Pacific convergence zone), including areas with active tropical cyclone activity. Since cold BTs of lower percentiles represent stronger convective events, this study provides, for the first time, global observational evidence of higher sensitivity of changes in stronger convective activity to a changing SST. This result has important potential implications in answering the key climate question of how severe tropical convection will change in a warming world. },

  Abstract                 = {The role of convective processes in moistening the atmosphere during suppressed periods of the suppressed phase of a MaddenâJulian oscillation is investigated in cloud-resolving model (CRM) simulations, and the impact of moistening on the subsequent evolution of convection is assessed as part of a Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment Cloud System Study (GCSS) intercomparison project. The ability of single-column model (SCM) versions of a number of state-of-the-art climate and numerical weather prediction models to capture these convective processes is also evaluated. During the suppressed periods, the CRMs are found to simulate a maximum moistening around 3 km, which is associated with a predominance of shallow convection. All SCMs produce adequate amounts of shallow convection during the suppressed periods, comparable to that seen in CRMs, but the relatively drier SCMs have higher precipitation rates than the relatively wetter SCMs and CRMs. The relatively drier SCMs dry, rather than moisten, the lower troposphere below the melting level. During the transition periods, convective processes act to moisten the atmosphere above the level at which mean advection changes from moistening to drying, despite an overall drying effect for the column. The SCMs capture some essence of this moistening at upper levels. A gradual transition from shallow to deep convection is simulated by the CRMs and the wetter SCMs during the transition periods, but the onset of deep convection is delayed in the drier SCMs. This results in lower precipitation rates for these SCMs during the active periods, although much better agreement exists between the models at this time.

  Abstract                 = {This study proposes another approach to develop multiyear single-column model (SCM) and cloud system-resolving model (CSRM) forcing data from numerical weather prediction (NWP) model analyses constrained with the observed surface and top of the atmosphere measurements by using a variational analysis approach. In the approach the atmospheric state variables from NWP analyses are adjusted to balance the observed column budgets of mass, heat, moisture, and momentum rather than the NWP model-produced budgets. The derived constrained NWP forcing data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration rapid update cycle (RUC) analyses are evaluated by the observed forcing data derived from radiosonde and wind profiler data collected at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program Southern Great Plains site under three selected cases: A strong convective case in the ARM summer 1997 intensive operational period (IOP), a moderate synoptic-scale process-dominated precipitation period in the spring 2000 IOP, and a nonprecipitation period in the late fall 2000 IOP. We show that the forcing data derived from the RUC analyses using ARM column constraints agree with the observed forcing reasonably well. The largest improvements are seen during precipitation periods since precipitation is a strong constraint used in the proposed approach. During the nonprecipitation period the improvements are moderate because the constraints are weak in the absence of precipitation. The constrained NWP forcing and the observed forcing, however, show better agreement during the moderate precipitation period and the nonprecipitation period than during the strong convective period. In SCM tests we show that most model errors revealed by the SCM driven by the observed forcing can be seen in the SCM driven by the constrained NWP forcing. These results suggest the feasibility of using the derived constrained NWP forcing data from RUC analyses for statistical studies of SCM/CSRM results over long time periods.},

The comparison covers the following three different synoptic conditions: a strong precipitation period dominated by subgrid scale processes during the ARM summer 1997 Intensive Operational Period (IOP), a moderate precipitation period dominated by synoptic scale processes during the spring 2000 IOP, and a nonprecipitation period during the fall 2000 IOP. In the study we demonstrate that the differences between the two forcing data sets are considerably large during the strong convective precipitation period, while they are much less during the moderate and nonprecipitation periods. By analyzing the column-integrated heat and moisture budgets we show that errors in the ECMWF-model-derived forcing are closely associated with errors in the model-predicted surface precipitation, which largely reflect deficiencies of model parameterizations. In SCM tests we show that SCM simulations are sensitive to the prescribed large-scale forcing data. The simulation errors are not well correlated between the SCM runs with the two different forcing data sets for all the three cases. Some important SCM simulated fields, such as surface precipitation, tend to follow the ECMWF model simulations rather than the observations when it is forced with the ECMWF forcing, especially for the summer case.},

  Abstract                 = {During the Monsoon Asian Hydro−Atmosphere Scientific Research and Prediction Initiative (MAHASRI; 2006-16), we carried out two projects over the Indonesian maritime continent (IMC), constructing the Hydrometeorological Array for Intraseasonal Variation−Monsoon Automonitoring (HARIMAU; 2005-10) radar network and setting up a prototype institute for climate studies, the Maritime Continent Center of Excellence (MCCOE; 2009-14). Here, we review the climatological features of the world’s largest “regional” rainfall over the IMC studied in these projects. The fundamental mode of atmospheric variability over the IMC is the diurnal cycle generated along coastlines by land−sea temperature contrast: afternoon land becomes hotter than sea by clear-sky insolation before noon, with the opposite contrast before sunrise caused by evening rainfall-induced “sprinkler”-like land cooling (different from the extratropical infrared cooling on clear nights). Thus, unlike the extratropics, the diurnal cycle over the IMC is more important in the rainy season. The intraseasonal, seasonal to annual, and interannual climate variabilities appear as amplitude modulations of the diurnal cycle. For example, in Jawa and Bali the rainy season is the southern hemispheric summer, because land heating in the clear morning and water vapor transport by afternoon sea breeze is strongest in the season of maximum insolation. During El Niño, cooler sea water surrounding the IMC makes morning maritime convection and rainfall weaker than normal. Because the diurnal cycle is almost the only mechanism generating convective clouds systematically near the equator with little cyclone activity, the local annual rainfall amount in the tropics is a steeply decreasing function of coastal distance (e-folding scale 100-300 km), and regional annual rainfall is an increasing function of “coastline density” (coastal length/land area) measured at a horizontal resolution of 100 km. The coastline density effect explains why rainfall and latent heating over the IMC are twice the global mean for an area that makes up only 4% of the Earth’s surface. The diurnal cycles appearing almost synchronously over the whole IMC generate teleconnections between the IMC convection and the global climate. Thus, high-resolution (<< 100 km; << 1 day) observations and models over the IMC are essential to improve both local disaster prevention and global climate prediction.},

  Abstract                 = {Atmospheric convection has a tendency to organize on a hierarchy of scales ranging from the mesoscale to the planetary scales, with the latter especially manifested by the Madden–Julian oscillation. The present paper examines two major competing mechanisms of self-organization in a cloud-resolving model (CRM) simulation from a phenomenological thermodynamic point of view.

The first mechanism is self-organized criticality. A saturation tendency of precipitation rate with increasing column-integrated water, reminiscent of critical phenomena, indicates self-organized criticality. The second is a self-regulation mechanism that is known as homeostasis in biology. A thermodynamic argument suggests that such self-regulation maintains the column-integrated water below a threshold by increasing the precipitation rate. Previous analyses of both observational data as well as CRM experiments give mixed results.

In this study, a CRM experiment over a large-scale domain with a constant sea surface temperature is analyzed. This analysis shows that the relation between the column-integrated total water and precipitation suggests self-organized criticality, whereas the one between the column-integrated water vapor and precipitation suggests homeostasis. The concurrent presence of these two mechanisms is further elaborated by detailed statistical and budget analyses. These statistics are scale invariant, reflecting a spatial scaling of precipitation processes.},

  Abstract                 = {The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant component of the intraseasonal (30â90 days) variability in the tropical atmosphere. It consists of large-scale coupled patterns in atmospheric circulation and deep convection, with coherent signals in many other variables, all propagating eastward slowly (â¼5 m sâ1) through the portion of the Indian and Pacific oceans where the sea surface is warm. It constantly interacts with the underlying ocean and influences many weather and climate systems. The past decade has witnessed an expeditious progress in the study of the MJO: Its large-scale and multiscale structures are better described, its scale interaction is recognized, its broad influences on tropical and extratropical weather and climate are increasingly appreciated, and its mechanisms for disturbing the ocean are further comprehended. Yet we are facing great difficulties in accurately simulating and predicting the MJO using sophisticated global weather forecast and climate models, and we are unable to explain such difficulties based on existing theories of the MJO. It is fair to say that the MJO remains an unmet challenge to our understanding of the tropical atmosphere and to our ability to simulate and predict its variability. This review, motivated by both the acceleration and gaps in our knowledge of the MJO, intends to synthesize what we currently know and what we do not know on selected topics: its observed basic characteristics, mechanisms, numerical modeling, air-sea interaction, and influences on the El NiÃ±o and Southern Oscillation.},

  Abstract                 = {A combination of observations and a numerical model revealed the meso-scale structure of the near-surface atmospheric conditions over the Persian Gulf. Low-level winds were dominated by a single, coherent, perennial land‚Äìsea breeze circulation (LSBC) that varied seasonally and diurnally. In summer the sea breeze was deeper and wider than in winter. At night the core of the LSBC over the Gulf was confluent with uplift, whereas in daytime it was difluent with subsidence. Sensitivity tests with the model revealed the influence on the LSBC of the land‚Äìsea distribution, orography and the ambient wind. The latter resulted in different conditions over the north, east, south and west coasts. Over the north coast, where the opposing ambient wind created a sea breeze front, landward penetration was very limited; over the south coast it was over 250 km. The thermal effect of the Iranian mountains accentuated the depth and penetration, landward and seaward, of the LSBC, thus influencing the duration of the land and sea breezes over the east coast. From spring to autumn the marine boundary layer over the Gulf was shallow, cool, moist and stable, with strong vertical gradients of temperature and humidity at its top. Its depth increased in the ambient flow from northwest to southeast and also, in daytime, from west to east, because of different magnitudes of the subsidence in the sea breeze circulation over the west and east coasts.

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT During 2005–2006, ACTIVE and two other joint field campaigns were conducted near the Tiwi Islands, north of Darwin, Australia where a local thunderstorm, known as Hector, was very well observed. The dataset collected during the campaign are used to validate a meso-scale model using different set-ups. Four cases of the Hector storm were simulated by running the WRF model in two modes: with or without incorporating local enhanced observations. In the ‘operational forecast mode’ (OP) the model was run in triply nested domains, with model initial and lateral boundary conditions provided solely by operational global analyses, and the finest domain having a horizontal resolution of 1 km. In the ‘observed data incorporation mode’ (DI) the model used a single domain at 1 km horizontal resolution, with either radiosonde or aircraft data incorporated during the run. All runs were validated against available observational data. The results showed that only one in four Hector cases was well simulated by the OP mode run, while three other Hector cases were simulated well in the DI mode. For all Hector-produced runs the general evolution and microphysical structure of the storm were reasonably simulated with some notable differences. A large deficiency in all the simulated storms was their smaller size and weaker intensity in comparison with the observed storms.},

  Abstract                 = {Using the hourly precipitation data at 123 gauge stations of Shandong province in eastern China during 1996â2008, the authors examine the spatial distribution of summer (JuneâJulyâAugust) precipitation amount (PA), precipitation intensity (PI), and precipitation frequency (PF) and their diurnal cycles. The results show that the diurnal peak of PA decreases from the southeastern to northwestern Shandong and mainly appears in the early morning and afternoon. The large diurnal peak of PA mainly appears in a large area from the hilly areas of southern Shandong to the eastern coasts. Large diurnal peak of PI mainly appears along the lower reaches of the Yellow River in northern Shandong. The diurnal peak of PF also decreases from southeastern to northwestern Shandong. The diurnal cycles of PA and PI have two peaks and they occur in the early morning and the afternoon, respectively. The diurnal cycle of PF has one peak in the morning. Large PA values show a southwestward time delay over northwestern Shandong, a northeastward time delay over central and southeastern Shandong in the afternoon, and a southeastward time delay over central and southeastern Shandong in the morning. Moreover, they also show a time delay from the central mountains of Shandong to its adjacent areas in the afternoon. When hourly precipitation is weaker, the diurnal cycles of PA and PF show a two-peak feature. With following the increase of hourly precipitation, the diurnal peak number also tends to increase.

  Abstract                 = {Vertically Integrated Moisture Flux Convergence (VIMFC) alone and in combination with the lifted stability index of the most unstable layer (SMUL) is evaluated as a thunderstorm predictor. By using six-hourly standard pressure weather analysis data from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) during 30 days in the summers of 1992 and 1994 containing several severe weather events along with quiescent events in northwestern Europe 17,206 events are obtained. The location and time of a lightning discharge are obtained from the Arrival Time Difference (ATD) sferics lightning location system from the \{UK\} Meteorological Office. Using the Heidke Skill Score (HEIDKE) to determine the best threshold we conclude that \{VIMFC\} alone, does not perform well as a dichotomous thunderstorm predictor compared to the stability index. However, the Thundery Case Probability (TCP) tested as function of \{VIMFC\} results in a high correlation with thunderstorms. By combining \{SMUL\} and \{VIMFC\} the surplus value as a thunderstorm predictor of \{VIMFC\} was established. \{TCP\} percentages up to 95% were found in an unstable environment with high positive values of VIMFC. In a marginally unstable environment with a high positive \{VIMFC\} the thunderstorm probability is higher than in a very unstable environment with no or negative VIMFC. These results are illustrated with a study of the case of the disastrous flash flood at Vaison-La-Romaine (southeastern France) on September 22, 1992. Although latent instability was present in a large area surrounding Vaison-La-Romaine, nearly all and especially the most severe thunderstorm activity occurred within the smaller area with positive \{VIMFC\} and latent instability.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study evaluates the performance and benefits of kilometre- and subkilometre-scale convection-permitting simulations over tropical Australia. Focusing on an extended monsoon break period, we can directly compare Unified Model (UM) and Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) simulations to C-band polarimetric radar observations and soundings. We show that the two models have different behaviour, and both are different to observations. Whereas WRF produces daily squall lines whether or not they occurred in observations, the UM primarily generates small but intense storms. The UM and WRF produce qualitatively different surface density currents at different times in the diurnal cycle. Once the density currents are present, the models also show different behaviour in relation to convective initiation. While higher resolution helps in the distribution of total precipitation over the domain, most characteristics do not change with higher resolutions, and model differences are always larger than resolution differences. While Convective Available Potential Energy/Convective Inhibition (CAPE/CIN) does not seem to be important to explain model differences, our findings point to the evolution of density currents in the boundary layer as the most important source of model errors and differences.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Numerical weather prediction (NWP) capabilities in the Maritime Continent are not as developed as in the midlatitudes. Countries in the region do not develop their own modelling systems; rather they adapt models primarily developed for the midlatitudes. Due to the complexity of processes involved in the region, this adaptation is non-trivial. In this article the developments made by the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) and the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) to implement a convective-scale NWP system for short-range weather prediction for Singapore and the surrounding regions are presented. In particular, this article describes the changes to the initial model configuration, which was based on the UKMO's convective-scale NWP system (the UKV), to produce operational forecasts over this region. Results presented here demonstrate the benefit of convection-permitting simulations over convection parametrized simulations and show that the model performance is greatly affected by the choice of driving model, the cloud scheme, and the turbulence scheme.},
